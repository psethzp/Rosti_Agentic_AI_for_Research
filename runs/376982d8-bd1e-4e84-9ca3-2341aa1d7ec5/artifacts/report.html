      <section class='insight'><h3>i0001 · Confidence 0.95</h3><p><strong>Summary:</strong> The system employs a mixed-reality immersive environment with specific tasks and multi-sensory feedback to aid stroke survivors in motor rehabilitation.</p><p>The core of the rehabilitation approach involves a mixed-reality system, utilizing the Quest 3S headset to create an immersive training environment for stroke survivors (c0001). This environment features two key tasks: an ARAT-aligned pouring task and an MX Ink tracing task, both designed to enhance selective muscle activation in the arms (c0001). The training experience is enriched through visual cues like neon halos and virtual liquid particles, auditory elements, and haptic feedback such as haptic ticks, aiming to directly address motor impairments (c0001, c0003). While the system shows potential for clinical application due to its intuitiveness and gamified elements, it is currently in an early development stage with a pilot study planned, rather than being a fully developed clinical tool (c0001).</p><p class='provenance'><strong>Provenance:</strong> MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1</p></section>
<section class='insight'><h3>i0002 · Confidence 0.93</h3><p><strong>Summary:</strong> Adaptive difficulty and fading feedback mechanisms are integrated to personalize the rehabilitation experience and track user progress.</p><p>To tailor the rehabilitation process, an adaptive controller is implemented that dynamically adjusts task difficulty based on user performance, modifying parameters like corridor width and tilt window (c0002). The feedback system is designed to evolve over time, transitioning from knowledge of performance to knowledge of results as the user improves (c0002). Real-time visual cues, including halos and ticks, along with projected dashboard metrics, provide continuous performance monitoring (c0002, c0004). Although the evidence highlights the implementation of these adaptive features, it also points to initial challenges such as overreactive difficulty oscillations and metric drift, which are being addressed through technical solutions (c0002, c0003).</p><p class='provenance'><strong>Provenance:</strong> MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1</p></section>
<section class='insight'><h3>i0003 · Confidence 0.90</h3><p><strong>Summary:</strong> The system&#x27;s development is structured into distinct work packages focusing on task implementation, adaptive control, and demonstration, with ongoing efforts to address technical challenges.</p><p>The development of the rehabilitation system is organized into specific work packages, with Work Package 2 dedicated to building the Passthrough Pouring and MX Ink Tracing tasks, including visual and haptic feedback elements (c0003). Work Package 3 focuses on creating the adaptive controller and logging system, responsible for rule-based adaptation of task parameters and feedback fading (c0003). While these work packages detail technical implementations, the direct link to helping stroke victims is implied rather than explicitly stated in the evidence (c0003). Furthermore, a live demonstration is planned to showcase the system&#x27;s capabilities, including calibration, user performance, and real-time feedback, but this is part of the development and pilot study phase, not direct patient interaction (c0004). Challenges such as anchor drift and inconsistent haptic support are actively being addressed within these development stages (c0003).</p><p class='provenance'><strong>Provenance:</strong> MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2</p></section>

      <h2>Suggested Actions & Next Hypotheses</h2>
      <section class='action'><h4>Validate Clinical Efficacy Beyond Proof-of-Concept · NextStep</h4><p>While the system is presented as a proof-of-concept with potential for clinical application (c0001), the current evidence focuses on system development and pilot studies (c0004). A critical next step is to design and execute a pilot clinical study with actual stroke survivors to gather preliminary data on the system&#x27;s efficacy in improving motor function, user engagement, and safety. This will help bridge the gap between development and validated clinical use.</p></section>
<section class='action'><h4>Investigate Long-Term Adaptability and User Retention · Hypothesis</h4><p>The system incorporates adaptive difficulty and fading feedback (c0002, i0002), which is promising for personalized rehabilitation. However, it&#x27;s unclear how well these mechanisms will adapt over extended periods of use and whether they will maintain user engagement and prevent plateaus in progress. A hypothesis to test is that the current adaptive algorithms may require further refinement to account for long-term user progression and potential boredom. Future work should explore more sophisticated adaptation strategies and investigate user retention rates over longer training durations.</p></section>
<section class='action'><h4>Clarify the Direct Link Between Technical Features and Stroke Victim Outcomes · Clarification</h4><p>Work packages are detailed with specific technical implementations (c0003), and the system aims to improve selective muscle activation (c0001). However, the direct causal link between specific technical features (e.g., haptic ticks, neon halos, specific adaptive parameters) and measurable improvements in stroke victim motor function needs to be more explicitly articulated and validated. Clarification is needed on how each technical component directly contributes to the rehabilitation goals for stroke survivors.</p></section>
<section class='action'><h4>Explore Broader Applications and Task Variety · Hypothesis</h4><p>The current focus is on arm motor impairments through pouring and tracing tasks (c0001). To maximize the impact of the mixed-reality rehabilitation system, a hypothesis to explore is that expanding the task repertoire to address other motor deficits (e.g., hand dexterity, trunk control) or even cognitive aspects of stroke recovery could significantly broaden the system&#x27;s utility. Future research could investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of developing new tasks within the existing mixed-reality framework.</p></section>
<section class='action'><h4>Address Potential for Over-Adaptation and Metric Drift in Real-World Settings · NextStep</h4><p>While solutions like moving averages and buffered writes are proposed to address overreactive difficulty oscillation and metric drift (c0002), the effectiveness of these solutions in a live clinical setting with diverse user populations remains to be demonstrated. A next step is to rigorously test these mitigation strategies during the planned pilot study (c0004) and gather data on their performance. This will inform necessary adjustments to the adaptive controller to ensure robust and reliable performance in a clinical environment.</p></section>
