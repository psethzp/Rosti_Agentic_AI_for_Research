    "claim_text": "The system utilizes a mixed-reality approach, specifically the Quest 3S headset, to create an immersive training environment for stroke survivors. It incorporates two primary tasks: an ARAT-aligned pouring task and an MX Ink tracing task, designed to improve selective muscle activation in the arms. The training is enhanced by visual, auditory, and haptic feedback mechanisms, including neon halos, virtual liquid particles, and haptic ticks. The goal is to provide a proof-of-concept system for stroke rehabilitation that directly addresses motor impairments in the arms. The system's intuitiveness is further supported by gamified elements and motivational feedback, suggesting potential for clinical application.",
    "summary": "The claim describes a fully developed system with clinical application potential, but the evidence points to an early-stage development with a pilot study planned.",
    "detail": "The claim presents the system as a proof-of-concept with potential for clinical application, highlighting its immersive training environment and feedback mechanisms. However, the evidence (E1) describes work packages focused on developing an adaptive controller and logging (Weeks 6-8) and a pilot study with 5-10 participants (Weeks 9-12). This suggests the system is still in the development and testing phase, and its clinical applicability has not yet been established or proven.",

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT\nGoal: To build NeuroReach VR \u2013 a proof-of-concept mixed-reality system that trains stroke reach and grasp using\nan ARAT-aligned pouring task [1] and an MX Ink tracing task with visual, auditory and haptic feedback [6], to\nimprove selective muscle activation in the arms for stroke rehabilitation.

We compute on path, time in tilt\nwindow, spill proxy and smoothness with SPARC, and adapt difficulty to keep the user in a target corridor.\nRationale: The design draws on motor learning and control theory, emphasizing that stroke recovery combines\nadaptation and skill learning to achieve specific task goals [5]. Guided by optimal feedback control, path corri-\ndors, goal halos, and error-contingent cues support goal-directed corrections. Task-specific ADL movements with\nvalidated kinematic metrics use SPARC for smoothness, while conservative auditory pacing maintains performance\nconsistency [3].\nII.

    "claim_id": "c0001",
    "claim_text": "The system utilizes a mixed-reality approach, specifically the Quest 3S headset, to create an immersive training environment for stroke survivors. It incorporates two primary tasks: an ARAT-aligned pouring task and an MX Ink tracing task, designed to improve selective muscle activation in the arms. The training is enhanced by visual, auditory, and haptic feedback mechanisms, including neon halos, virtual liquid particles, and haptic ticks. The goal is to provide a proof-of-concept system for stroke rehabilitation that directly addresses motor impairments in the arms. The system's intuitiveness is further supported by gamified elements and motivational feedback, suggesting potential for clinical application.",
    "summary": "The claim emphasizes the system's intuitiveness and gamified elements, while the evidence focuses on technical challenges and potential solutions.",
    "detail": "The claim suggests the system's intuitiveness is supported by gamified elements and motivational feedback, implying a user-friendly experience. In contrast, the evidence (E1) details technical challenges such as 'overreactive difficulty oscillation' and 'metric drift across sessions,' along with proposed solutions like 'moving average with gates and floors.' This highlights a potential disconnect between the perceived user experience and the underlying technical complexities and stability issues that need to be addressed.",

Fl\u00a8uckiger\nDescription: Rule based adaptation of corridor, tilt window and tracing tunnel; feedback fading from knowledge of\nperformance to knowledge of results; Outcomes: Adaptive controller with hysteresis; 50 to 90 Hz logging with rolling\nsummaries. Challenges: Overreactive difficulty oscillation; metric drift across sessions. Solutions: Moving average\nwith gates and floors; buffered asynchronous writes and per trial files. Alternatives: Manual override switches;\nlightweight local database if CSV grows; fixed difficulty presets.\nWork Package 4 : Pilot study and analysis (Weeks 9\u201312)\nMembers Responsible: P. S. Purkayastha, R. Khoshimov\nDescription: Evaluate the system with a 5-10 participant pilot study; Test usability and performance using a baseline,\ntraining, retention protocol to inform final refinements. Outcomes: A polished system with documentation; A formal\nstudy protocol with a performance dataset; A completed usability and analysis report. Challenges: Participant\nrecruitment delays; Technical instability. Solutions: Recruit early; Conduct internal dry runs to fix bugs. Alternatives:\nUse a smaller cohort; Simplify the protocol if technical issues arise.\nIII. OUTCOMES AND DEMONSTRATION\nExpected outcomes: (i) A working proof-of-concept prototype that turns kinematics into adaptive multimodal\nfeedback during pouring and tracing (ii) A logging and analytics tool that summarizes on path, tilt window, spills\nproxy and SPARC smoothness (iii) A small pilot indicating increased time in tilt window and reduced RMS path\nerror with improved SPARC, consistent with drinking task kinematics and smoothness literature [5].\nEvaluation plans: (i) A preliminary usability study with physiotherapists, collecting qualitative feedback through a\nthink-aloud protocol and post-session questionnaires. (ii) Assess the system\u2019s perceived effectiveness, ease of use,\nand fit to ARAT aligned tasks, with specific focus on clarity of halos, ticks and result cards (iii) Focus on the\nintuitiveness of the feedback mechanisms and the motivational aspect of the gamified environment, with potential\nfor clinical application.\nDemonstration plan: (i) Live on-headset demo with quick anchor calibration, where user performs two one minute\npouring blocks and two tracing blocks with real time halos, ticks and error bars (ii) Projected dashboard shows\non path, tilt window, spills proxy, RMS error"
