    "detail": "The claim mentions a 'Quest 3S headset' (c0001), but the evidence does not specify the VR hardware being used. Given that anchor drift and inconsistent haptic support are identified challenges (c0003), understanding the exact hardware and its known limitations or capabilities in these areas is crucial for assessing the feasibility and robustness of the NeuroReach VR system. This clarification will inform potential mitigation strategies and the overall reliability of the system's immersive and interactive features.",

    "detail": "The system's adaptive controller is designed to adjust task parameters and fade feedback based on user performance (c0002, c0004). However, the evidence focuses on the implementation details rather than the direct impact on rehabilitation outcomes. A hypothesis needs to be formed and tested regarding how specific adaptive strategies (e.g., the rate of difficulty increase, the transition from knowledge of performance to knowledge of results) correlate with improved reach and grasp movements in stroke patients. This will require defining specific performance benchmarks and measuring patient progress.",

To fully understand the adaptive controller's capabilities and its potential for clinical application, it's essential to clarify if SPARC metrics are indeed being used and how they, along with the other mentioned metrics, are being translated into adjustments for difficulty and feedback fading.

While solutions like relocalizing anchors and low-pass filtering are being explored, the claim also mentions alternative solutions such as using fiducials instead of anchors or running tracing without haptics. Further investigation into the feasibility and trade-offs of these alternatives, particularly in a clinical environment where reliability and patient experience are paramount, is a critical next step. This will inform the most robust and clinically viable path forward.",
