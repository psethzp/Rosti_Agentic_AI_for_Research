    "claim_text": "The NeuroReach VR system aims to train stroke patients in reach and grasp movements using an ARAT-aligned pouring task and an MX Ink tracing task. This system will provide visual, auditory, and haptic feedback to enhance selective muscle activation in the arms for stroke rehabilitation. The project utilizes a Quest 3S headset with Shared Spatial Anchors to create an immersive and interactive training environment. The intuitiveness of feedback mechanisms and the motivational aspect of the gamified environment are key features of the system, with potential for clinical application.",
    "summary": "The evidence suggests the system is still in development with significant challenges and potential alternatives, indicating it may not be ready for clinical application as claimed.",
    "detail": "The evidence snippets highlight several challenges in the development of the NeuroReach VR system, including 'anchor drift,' 'noisy tilt estimation,' and 'inconsistent haptic support' (E2). Furthermore, the proposed solutions involve workarounds like 'relocalizing anchors at session start' and 'low pass tilt and debounce events' (E2), suggesting the core technology is not yet robust. The project also considers alternatives such as 'using fiducials instead of anchors' or 'running tracing without haptics' (E2), which deviate from the claimed multimodal feedback system. The mention of a 'pilot study and analysis' with a small participant group (5-10) (E1) further indicates the system is in an early evaluation phase, not yet proven for clinical application.",

Guided by optimal feedback control, path corri-\ndors, goal halos, and error-contingent cues support goal-directed corrections.

        "chunk_text": "Outcomes: Unity project with anchors and passthrough; MX Ink tracing sample running with haptic\nticks; one tap calibration UI. Challenges: Anchor drift; noisy tilt estimation; inconsistent haptic support. Solutions:\nRelocalize anchors at session start; low pass tilt and debounce events;. Alternatives: Use fiducials instead of anchors;\nrun tracing without haptics.\nWork Package 2 : VR Task and Multimodal Feedback (Weeks 3\u20135)\nMembers Responsible: P. S. Purkayastha, R. Fl\u00a8uckiger\nDescription: Build Passthrough Pouring task; build MX Ink Tracing task; add neon halos and virtual liquid particles;\nOutcomes: Playable pouring with on path, tilt window and spill proxy; tracing with tunnel and live error; UI to\nconfigure thresholds and BPM; single screen results card. Challenges: Stable spill detection; tunnel width and tilt\nwindow tuning. Solutions: One trial calibration; on device tooltips and ghost path. Alternatives: Use geometric spill\nproxy; reduce tracing set to line and spiral."
