Addi-\ntionally, RoBERTa is trained on a much larger dataset, and\nhence clearly outperformed BERT and other models such as\nGPT-2 and XLNet by the time of its release.\nCurrently, the most widely used and the largest available\nlanguage model is GPT-3, which was also pre-trained on a\nmassive text dataset (including books, articles, and websites,\namong other sources) and has 175 billion parameters. As all\nother previously described language models, GPT-3 uses a\ntransformer architecture, which allows it to efficiently process\nsequential data and generate more coherent and contextually\nadjusted text. Indeed, text generated by GPT-3 is almost\nindistinguishable from human-written text [14]. With the\nability to perform zero-shot learning, GPT-3 can cope with\ntasks it has not been specifically trained on, providing hence\nenormous opportunities for applications, from automation\n(summarizing, completing texts from bullet points), to dialog\nsystems, chatbots, and creative writing.\nJust recently, the BigScience-community developed and\nreleased the large language model BLOOM (BigScience Large\nOpen-science Open-access Multilingual Language Model) [15]\nas on open-source joint project by HuggingFace, GENCI and\nIDRIS3. The aim of this project was to provide a transparently\ntrained multi-lingual language model for the academic and\nnon-profit community. BLOOM is based on the same trans-\nformer architecture as the models from the GPT-family with\nonly minor structural changes, but the training data was explic-\nitly chosen to cover 46 natural languages and 13 programming\nlanguages, resulting in a data volume of 1.6TB.\n2.2 Review of Research Applying Large Language\nModels in Education\nIn the following, we provide an overview of research works\nemploying large language models in education that were pub-\nlished since the release of the first large language model in\n2018.

Current Research and Applications of\nLanguage Models in Education\n2.1 Overview of Current Large Language Models\nThe GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) [10] model\ndeveloped by OpenAI was the first large language model that\nwas publicly released in 2018. GPT was able to generate\nhuman-like text, answer questions, and assist in tasks, such as\ntranslation and summarization, through human-like comple-\ntion. Based on this initial model, OpenAI later released the\nGPT-2 and GPT-3 models with more advanced capabilities.\nIt can be argued that the release of GPT marked a significant\nmilestone in the field of NLP and has opened up many ways\nfor dissemination, both in research and industrial applications.\nAnother model that was released by Google Research in\n2018 is BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers [2]), which is also based on a transformer ar-\nchitecture and is pre-trained on a massive dataset of text data\non two unsupervised tasks, namely masked language mod-\neling (to predict missing parts in a sentence and learn their\ncontext) and next sentence prediction (to learn plausible sub-\nsequent sentences of a given sentence) with the aim to learn\nthe broader context of words in various topics.\nOne year later in 2019, Google AI released XLNet [11],\nwhich is trained using a process called permutation language\nmodeling and enables XLNet to cope with tasks that involve\nunderstanding the dependencies between words in a sentence,\ne.g., natural language inference and question answering. An-\nother model developed by Google Research was T5 (Text-to-\nText Transfer Transformer) [12], which was released in 2020.\nLike the predecessor models, T5 is also transformer-based\nmodel trained on a massive text dataset with the key feature\nbeing its ability to perform many NLP tasks with a single\npre-training and fine-tuning pipeline.\nIn parallel with Open AI and Google, Facebook AI devel-\noped a large language model called RoBERTa (Robustly Opti-\nmized BERT Pre-training) [13], which was released in 2019.\nRoBERTa is a variant of the BERT model which uses dynamic\nmasking instead of static masking"
