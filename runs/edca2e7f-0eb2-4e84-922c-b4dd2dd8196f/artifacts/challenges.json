    "claim_text": "Teachers can utilize LLMs to assist in creating inclusive lesson plans and activities by inputting document corpora to generate course syllabi and topic descriptions (E3). LLMs can generate questions and prompts tailored to different knowledge and ability levels, encouraging participation and critical thinking (E3). For professional development, LLMs can provide teachers with resources, summaries, and explanations of new teaching methodologies and technologies, helping them stay current (E6). These models can also assist in assessment by evaluating student solutions and reducing grading effort, as demonstrated in large courses (E9). LLMs can also be used to generate targeted and personalized practice problems and quizzes for students, aiding in mastery (E3).",
    "summary": "The claim does not address potential biases and equity issues in LLM-generated educational content.",
    "detail": "The claim focuses on the benefits of LLMs for teachers and students, such as creating inclusive lesson plans and personalized practice. However, it fails to acknowledge the significant challenges related to bias and equitable access. E2 briefly mentions acquainting students with potential societal biases and risks of AI applications, but this is a general cautionary note rather than a solution. More importantly, E5 highlights that LLMs can exacerbate the education gap due to issues with multilingualism fairness and financial access, stating that without fair access, this AI technology may seriously widen the education gap. This directly contradicts the idea of LLMs being a universally beneficial tool for all teachers and students without addressing these critical equity concerns.",

Despite the efforts of various\nresearch communities to address multilingualism fairness for\nAI technologies, there is still much room for improvement.\nLastly, the unfairness related to financial means for access-\ning, training and maintaining large language models may need\nto be regulated by governmental organisations with the aim\nto provide equity-oriented means to all educational entities\ninterested in using these modern technologies. Without fair\naccess, this AI technology may seriously widen the education\ngap like no other technology before it.\nWe therefore conclude with UNESCO\u2019s call to ensure that\nAI does not widen the technological and educational divides\nwithin and between countries, and recommended important\nstrategies for the use of AI in a responsible and fair way to\nreduce this existing gap instead. According to the UNESCO\neducation 2030 Agenda [67]: \u201cUNESCO\u2019s mandate calls in-\nherently for a human-centred approach to AI.

Concluding Remarks\nThe use of large language models in education is a promising\narea of research that offers many opportunities to enhance the\nlearning experience for students and support the work of teach-\ners. However, to unleash their full potential for education, it is\ncrucial to approach the use of these models with caution and\nto critically evaluate their limitations and potential biases. In-\ntegrating large language models into education must therefore\nmeet stringent privacy, security, and - for sustainable scal-\ning - environmental, regulatory and ethical requirements, and\nmust be done in conjunction with ongoing human monitoring,\nguidance, and critical thinking.\nWhile this position paper reflects the optimism of the au-\nthors about the opportunities of large language models as a\ntransformative technology in"
