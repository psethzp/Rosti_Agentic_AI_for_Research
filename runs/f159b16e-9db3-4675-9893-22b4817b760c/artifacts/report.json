For students, LLMs act as powerful learning companions, aiding in skill development, providing grammatical and stylistic feedback, and fostering critical thinking through generated prompts and questions (c0001, c0002). Furthermore, LLMs can generate contextualized content, code, and multimedia, expanding learning possibilities and offering personalized guidance during discussions, though a challenge exists regarding potential over-reliance and hindering critical thinking if answers are too readily provided (c0001, c0002, c0003).",

A recent review of oppor-\ntunities and challenges of chatbots in education pointed out\nthat the studies related to chatbots in education are still in an\nearly stage, with few empirical studies investigating the use of\neffective learning designs or learning strategies [30]. There-\nfore, we discuss first the teachers\u2019 perspectives concerning AI\nand Learning Analytics in education and transfer these on the\nmuch newer field of large language models.\nIn this view, a pilot study with European teachers indi-\ncates a positive attitude towards AI for education and a high\nmotivation to introduce AI-related content at school. Overall,\nthe teachers from the study seemed to have a basic level of\ndigital skills but low AI-related skills [31]. Another study\nwith Nigerian teachers emphasized that the willingness and\nreadiness of teachers to promote AI are key prerequisites for\nthe integration of AI-based technologies in education [32].\nAlong the same lines, the results of a study with teachers from\nSouth Korea indicate that teachers with constructivist beliefs\nare more likely to integrate educational AI-based tools than\nteachers with transmissive orientations [33]. Furthermore, per-\nceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived trust in\nthese AI-based tools are determinants to be considered when\npredicting their acceptance by the teachers.

[37] examined an AI-based feedback\nsystem incorporating automated scoring technologies in the\ncontext of a high school climate activity task. The results show\nthat the feedback helped students revise their scientific argu-\nments. Sailer et al.

In their experimental study, they found that\npre-service teachers who received adaptive feedback were\nbetter able to justify their diagnoses than prospective teachers\nwho received static feedback. Bernius et al.

They can\nbe used to improve the clarity of the teaching materials, locate\ninformation or resources that professionals may be in need for\nas they learn on the job, as well as used for on-the-job training\nmodules that require presentation and communication skills.\nFor assessment and evaluation, teachers can use large\nlanguage models to semi-automate the grading of student work\nby highlighting potential strengths and weakness of the work\nin question, e.g., essays, research papers, and other writing\nassignments. This can save teachers a significant amount of\ntime for tasks related to individualized feedback to students.\nFurthermore, large language models can also be used to check\nfor plagiarism, which can help to prevent cheating. Hence,\nlarge language models can help teachers to identify areas\nwhere students are struggling, which adds to a more accurate\nassessments of student learning development and challenges.\nTargeted instruction provided by the models can be used to\nhelp students excel and to provide opportunities for further\ndevelopment.\nThe acquaintance of students with AI challenges related\nto the potential bias in the output, the need for continuous hu-\nman oversight, and the potential for misuse of large language\nmodels are not unique to education. In fact, these challenges\nare inherent to transformative digital technologies. Thus, we\nbelieve that, if handled sensibly by the teacher, these chal-\nlenges can be insightful in learning and education scenarios to\nacquaint students early on with potential societal biases, and\nrisks of AI application.\nIn conclusion, large language models have the potential\nto revolutionize teaching from a teacher\u2019s perspective by pro-\nviding teachers with a wide range of tools and resources that\ncan assist with lesson planning, personalized content creation,\ndifferentiation and personalized instruction, assessment, and\nprofessional development.

A recent review of oppor-\ntunities and challenges of chatbots in education pointed out\nthat the studies related to chatbots in education are still in an\nearly stage, with few empirical studies investigating the use of\neffective learning designs or learning strategies [30]. There-\nfore, we discuss first the teachers\u2019 perspectives concerning AI\nand Learning Analytics in education and transfer these on the\nmuch newer field of large language models.\nIn this view, a pilot study with European teachers indi-\ncates a positive attitude towards AI for education and a high\nmotivation to introduce AI-related content at school. Overall,\nthe teachers from the study seemed to have a basic level of\ndigital skills but low AI-related skills [31]. Another study\nwith Nigerian teachers emphasized that the willingness and\nreadiness of teachers to promote AI are key prerequisites for\nthe integration of AI-based technologies in education [32].\nAlong the same lines, the results of a study with teachers from\nSouth Korea indicate that teachers with constructivist beliefs\nare more likely to integrate educational AI-based tools than\nteachers with transmissive orientations [33]. Furthermore, per-\nceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived trust in\nthese AI-based tools are determinants to be considered when\npredicting their acceptance by the teachers. Similar results\nconcerning teachers attitudes towards chatbots in education\nwere reported in [34]: perceiving the AI chatbot as easy-to-\nuse and useful leads to greater acceptance of the chatbot.

[36] employed\na fine-tuned GPT-3 model to evaluate student-generated an-\nswers in a learning environment for chemistry education [36].\nThe authors argue that large language models might (espe-\ncially when fine-tuned to the specific domain) be a powerful\ntool to assist teachers in the quality and pedagogical evalua-\ntion of student answers [36]. In addition, the following studies\nexamined NLP-based models for generating automatic adap-\ntive feedback: Zhu et al. [37] examined an AI-based feedback\nsystem incorporating automated scoring technologies in the\ncontext of a high school climate activity task. The results show\nthat the feedback helped students revise their scientific argu-\nments. Sailer et al. [38] used NLP-based adaptive feedback\nin the context of diagnosing students\u2019 learning difficulties in\nteacher education. In their experimental study, they found that\npre-service teachers who received adaptive feedback were\nbetter able to justify their diagnoses than prospective teachers\nwho received static feedback. Bernius et al. [39] used NLP-\nbased models to generate feedback for textual student answers\nin large courses, where grading effort could be reduced by\nup to 85% with a high precision and an improved quality\nperceived by the students.\nLarge language models can not only support the assess-\nment of student\u2019s solutions but also assist in the automatic\ngeneration of exercises.
