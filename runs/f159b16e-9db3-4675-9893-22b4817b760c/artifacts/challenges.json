For students, LLMs can aid in developing reading and writing skills, suggesting grammatical corrections, improving writing style, and fostering critical thinking through generated questions and prompts. LLMs offer professional development opportunities for teachers by providing resources, summaries, and explanations of new teaching methodologies and technologies, helping them stay current. These models can also be adapted by specialists to meet the specific needs of learners with disabilities and assist in professional training for field-specific language skills, programming, and project management.",
