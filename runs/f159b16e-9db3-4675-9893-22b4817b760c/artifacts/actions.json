This could involve designing prompts that require students to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information provided by the LLM, or using LLMs to generate counter-arguments for students to deconstruct.",

This action involves creating guidelines and training materials for educators and students on how to use LLMs as supplementary tools rather than primary sources of answers or assessment.

This pilot should focus on specific, well-defined use cases in medical education where LLMs can supplement learning, with strict protocols in place to ensure human oversight, critical evaluation of LLM outputs, and clear communication of limitations to students.",
