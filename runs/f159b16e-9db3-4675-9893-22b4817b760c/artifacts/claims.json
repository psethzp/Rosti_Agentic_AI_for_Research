On Opportunities and Challenges of Large Language Models for Education \u2014 6/13\neral works discuss the automatic generation of math word\nproblems [44, 45, 46], which combines the challenge of un-\nderstanding equations and putting them into the appropriate\ncontext.\nFinally, another recent work [47] investigated the capabil-\nity of state-of-the-art conversational agents to adequately reply\nto a student in an educational dialogue. Both models used in\nthis work (Blender and GPT-3) were capable of replying to\na student adequately and generated conversational dialogues\nthat conveyed the impression that these models understand the\nlearner (in particular Blender). They are however well behind\nhuman performance when it comes to helping the student [47],\nthus emphasizing the need for further research.\n3. Opportunities for Innovative\nEducational Technologies\nLooking forward, large language models bear the potential to\nconsiderably improve digital ecosystems for education, such\nas environments based on Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual\nReality (VR) [48, 49], and other related digital experiences.\nSpecifically, they can be used to amplify several key fac-\ntors, which are crucial for the immersive interaction of users\nwith digital content. For example, large language models\ncan considerably improve the natural language processing\nand understanding capabilities of an AR/VR system to enable\nan effective natural communication and interaction between\nusers and the system (e.g., virtual teacher or virtual peers).\nThe latter has been identified early on as a key usability aspect\nfor immersive educational technologies [50] and is in general\nseen as a key factor for improving the interaction between\nhumans and AI systems [51].\nLarge language models can also be used to develop more\nnatural and sophisticated user interfaces by exploiting their\nability to generate contextualized, personalized, and diverse\nresponses to natural language questions asked by users. Fur-\nthermore, their ability to answer natural language questions\nacross various domains can facilitate the integration of diverse\ndigital applications into a unified framework or application,\nwhich is also critical for expanding the bounds of educational\npossibilities and experiences [52, 49].\nIn general, the ability of these models to generate contextu-\nalized natural language texts, code for various implementation"

The authors reported that the generated questions\nwere rated favorably by human experts, promoting thus the\nusage of large language models in data science education [20].\nStudents can learn from each other by peer-reviewing and\nassessing each other\u2019s solutions. This, of course, has the best\neffect when the given feedback is comprehensive and of high\nquality. For example, Jia et al. [21] showed how BERT can\nbe used to evaluate the peer assessments so that students can\nlearn to improve their feedback.\nIn a recent review on conversational AI in language edu-\ncation, the authors found that there are five main applications\nof conversational AI during teaching [22], the most common\none being the use of large language models as a conversa-\ntional partner in a written or oral form, e.g., in the context\nof a task-oriented dialogue that provides language practice\nopportunities such as pronunciation [23]. Another application\nis to support students when they experience foreign language\nlearning anxiety [24] or have a lower willingness to commu-\nnicate [25].

A recent review of oppor-\ntunities and challenges of chatbots in education pointed out\nthat the studies related to chatbots in education are still in an\nearly stage, with few empirical studies investigating the use of\neffective learning designs or learning strategies [30]. There-\nfore, we discuss first the teachers\u2019 perspectives concerning AI\nand Learning Analytics in education and transfer these on the\nmuch newer field of large language models.\nIn this view, a pilot study with European teachers indi-\ncates a positive attitude towards AI for education and a high\nmotivation to introduce AI-related content at school. Overall,\nthe teachers from the study seemed to have a basic level of\ndigital skills but low AI-related skills [31]. Another study\nwith Nigerian teachers emphasized that the willingness and\nreadiness of teachers to promote AI are key prerequisites for\nthe integration of AI-based technologies in education [32].\nAlong the same lines, the results of a study with teachers from\nSouth Korea indicate that teachers with constructivist beliefs\nare more likely to integrate educational AI-based tools than\nteachers with transmissive orientations [33]. Furthermore, per-\nceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived trust in\nthese AI-based tools are determinants to be considered when\npredicting their acceptance by the teachers. Similar results\nconcerning teachers attitudes towards chatbots in education\nwere reported in [34]: perceiving the AI chatbot as easy-to-\nuse and useful leads to greater acceptance of the chatbot.

[36] employed\na fine-tuned GPT-3 model to evaluate student-generated an-\nswers in a learning environment for chemistry education [36].\nThe authors argue that large language models might (espe-\ncially when fine-tuned to the specific domain) be a powerful\ntool to assist teachers in the quality and pedagogical evalua-\ntion of student answers [36]. In addition, the following studies\nexamined NLP-based models for generating automatic adap-\ntive feedback: Zhu et al. [37] examined an AI-based feedback\nsystem incorporating automated scoring technologies in the\ncontext of a high school climate activity task. The results show\nthat the feedback helped students revise their scientific argu-\nments. Sailer et al. [38] used NLP-based adaptive feedback\nin the context of diagnosing students\u2019 learning difficulties in\nteacher education. In their experimental study, they found that\npre-service teachers who received adaptive feedback were\nbetter able to justify their diagnoses than prospective teachers\nwho received static feedback. Bernius et al. [39] used NLP-\nbased models to generate feedback for textual student answers\nin large courses, where grading effort could be reduced by\nup to 85% with a high precision and an improved quality\nperceived by the students.\nLarge language models can not only support the assess-\nment of student\u2019s solutions but also assist in the automatic\ngeneration of exercises.

Additionally,\nextensive research has been conducted on fine-tuning these\nmodels on smaller datasets and applying transfer learning to\nnew problems. This allows for improved performance on\nspecific tasks with smaller amount of data.\nWhile large language models have made great strides in\nrecent years, there are still many limitations that need to be\naddressed. One major limitation is the lack of interpretabil-\nity, as it is difficult to understand the reasoning behind the\nmodel\u2019s predictions.
