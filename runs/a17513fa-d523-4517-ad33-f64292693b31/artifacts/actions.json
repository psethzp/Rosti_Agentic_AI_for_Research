Clarifying these aspects will allow for a more precise understanding of the system's intended impact and clinical utility.",

A hypothesis to explore is whether the gamified elements will translate into better long-term functional outcomes and patient engagement compared to non-gamified approaches.",

However, the evidence does not yet demonstrate the clinical efficacy of these specific ARAT-aligned tasks within the NeuroReach VR system in improving actual ARAT scores or other functional measures in stroke survivors. A next step would be to plan for clinical trials to validate this.",
