Challenges: Anchor drift; noisy tilt estimation; inconsistent haptic support. Solutions:\nRelocalize anchors at session start; low pass tilt and debounce events;. Alternatives: Use fiducials instead of anchors;\nrun tracing without haptics.\nWork Package 2 : VR Task and Multimodal Feedback (Weeks 3\u20135)\nMembers Responsible: P. S. Purkayastha, R. Fl\u00a8uckiger\nDescription: Build Passthrough Pouring task; build MX Ink Tracing task; add neon halos and virtual liquid particles;\nOutcomes: Playable pouring with on path, tilt window and spill proxy; tracing with tunnel and live error; UI to\nconfigure thresholds and BPM; single screen results card. Challenges: Stable spill detection; tunnel width and tilt\nwindow tuning. Solutions: One trial calibration; on device tooltips and ghost path. Alternatives: Use geometric spill\nproxy; reduce tracing set to line and spiral."
