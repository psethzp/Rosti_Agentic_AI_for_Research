      <section class='insight'><h3>i0001 · Confidence 0.90</h3><p><strong>Summary:</strong> The NeuroReach VR system aims to improve stroke rehabilitation by focusing on specific motor skills with multi-sensory feedback and adaptive challenges.</p><p>The NeuroReach VR system is designed to aid stroke survivors in regaining reach and grasp movements through gamified mixed-reality exercises, specifically a pouring task aligned with ARAT standards and an MX Ink tracing task (c0001). This rehabilitation approach incorporates visual cues like halos and virtual particles, auditory signals, and haptic feedback to guide and reinforce selective muscle activation (c0001, c0004). An adaptive controller dynamically adjusts task difficulty and feedback levels based on real-time performance metrics, transitioning from performance feedback to results feedback to enhance user engagement and learning (c0002). However, the specific stroke rehabilitation goals and target patient population are not detailed (c0001).</p><p class='provenance'><strong>Provenance:</strong> MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2</p></section>
<section class='insight'><h3>i0002 · Confidence 0.85</h3><p><strong>Summary:</strong> Technical hurdles in maintaining system stability and providing consistent feedback are being addressed through proposed solutions and adaptive control mechanisms.</p><p>The development of the NeuroReach VR system faces significant technical challenges, including anchor drift, inaccurate tilt estimation, and unreliable haptic feedback (c0003). To combat anchor drift, the system will be re-localized at the start of each session, and sensor data like tilt estimation will be filtered and debounced to improve accuracy (c0003). The adaptive controller, while intended to personalize the rehabilitation experience, must overcome issues like overshooting difficulty adjustments and metric drift, which are being managed through moving averages and buffered data writes (c0003). Despite claims of real-time feedback, the evidence points to challenges in achieving stable and consistent feedback mechanisms (c0002).</p><p class='provenance'><strong>Provenance:</strong> MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2</p></section>
<section class='insight'><h3>i0003 · Confidence 0.75</h3><p><strong>Summary:</strong> The system&#x27;s motivational aspects and performance tracking are intended to enhance user engagement, though some details remain unconfirmed.</p><p>The NeuroReach VR system aims to increase user motivation through gamified elements and a projected dashboard displaying key performance metrics (c0002). While the claim suggests gamification for motivation, the evidence does not explicitly confirm its integration (c0001). The projected dashboard is intended to show metrics such as on path, tilt window, spills proxy, RMS error, and SPARC, updated per trial (c0002). However, the evidence only partially lists these metrics and their implementation status, indicating an incomplete picture of the performance tracking capabilities (c0002).</p><p class='provenance'><strong>Provenance:</strong> MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2</p></section>

      <h2>Suggested Actions & Next Hypotheses</h2>
      <section class='action'><h4>Clarify Target Patient Population and Specific Stroke Rehabilitation Goals · Clarification</h4><p>The current claims describe the NeuroReach VR system&#x27;s capabilities for reach and grasp training but lack specificity regarding the exact stroke rehabilitation goals (e.g., specific functional deficits addressed) and the target patient population (e.g., stroke phase, severity of impairment). Clarifying these aspects will allow for a more precise understanding of the system&#x27;s intended impact and clinical utility.</p></section>
<section class='action'><h4>Hypothesize the Impact of Gamification on Long-Term Adherence · Hypothesis</h4><p>While the system is designed with gamified elements to increase motivation (c0001, c0002), the long-term effectiveness of these elements in promoting sustained user adherence to the rehabilitation program is not yet established. A hypothesis to explore is whether the gamified elements will translate into better long-term functional outcomes and patient engagement compared to non-gamified approaches.</p></section>
<section class='action'><h4>Investigate the Clinical Efficacy of ARAT-Aligned Tasks · NextStep</h4><p>The pouring task is designed to be ARAT-aligned (c0004), which is a recognized assessment tool. However, the evidence does not yet demonstrate the clinical efficacy of these specific ARAT-aligned tasks within the NeuroReach VR system in improving actual ARAT scores or other functional measures in stroke survivors. A next step would be to plan for clinical trials to validate this.</p></section>
<section class='action'><h4>Clarify the Status and Implementation of All Projected Dashboard Metrics · Clarification</h4><p>The projected dashboard is mentioned to display performance metrics (c0002), but only a partial list is provided, and the implementation status of each metric is not fully detailed. Clarification is needed on which metrics are fully implemented, which are in development, and how they will be used to inform the adaptive controller and patient progress tracking.</p></section>
<section class='action'><h4>Hypothesize the Correlation Between Sensor Feedback Consistency and Rehabilitation Outcomes · Hypothesis</h4><p>The system aims to provide multi-sensory feedback (c0001), but technical challenges with consistent haptic support and tilt estimation exist (c0003). A hypothesis to investigate is whether the consistency and reliability of this feedback directly correlate with the effectiveness of the rehabilitation, particularly in improving selective muscle activation and overall motor control.</p></section>
