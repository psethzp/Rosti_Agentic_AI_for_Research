To fully understand the system's sophistication and potential clinical impact, a deeper exploration of the adaptive controller's logic and the precise mechanisms of feedback fading is required.",

A hypothesis is that these solutions significantly improve system stability and reduce the impact of these challenges. Further investigation is needed to measure the reduction in anchor drift and improvement in tilt estimation accuracy post-implementation.",

However, the evidence only partially lists these metrics and does not confirm their real-time update frequency or accuracy. A next step is to verify the complete list of dashboard metrics and confirm that they are indeed updated in real-time for each trial, providing immediate feedback to clinicians and patients.",
