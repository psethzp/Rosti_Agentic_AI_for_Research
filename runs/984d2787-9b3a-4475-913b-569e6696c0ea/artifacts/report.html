      <section class='insight'><h3>i0001 · Confidence 0.90</h3><p><strong>Summary:</strong> The NeuroReach VR system offers a novel approach to stroke rehabilitation through engaging mixed-reality tasks with adaptive feedback.</p><p>The NeuroReach VR system is designed to train stroke patients in essential reach and grasp movements using immersive mixed-reality tasks like pouring and tracing (c0001). These tasks are enhanced by multimodal feedback (visual, auditory, haptic) and a projected dashboard displaying real-time performance metrics (c0002). The system&#x27;s adaptive controller dynamically adjusts difficulty and feedback based on user progress, transitioning from performance to results-based feedback as rehabilitation advances (c0002). This innovative approach aims to improve patient engagement and clinical outcomes in stroke recovery.</p><p class='provenance'><strong>Provenance:</strong> MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2</p></section>
<section class='insight'><h3>i0002 · Confidence 0.85</h3><p><strong>Summary:</strong> Technical challenges in mixed-reality implementation are being addressed with specific solutions to ensure system stability and functionality.</p><p>The development of the NeuroReach VR system faces technical hurdles such as anchor drift and noisy tilt estimation, for which solutions are being implemented (c0003). These include relocalizing anchors and employing filtering techniques for tilt estimation. The project also aims to deliver a functional Unity project with specific features, though the extent of these deliverables is not fully confirmed by the evidence (c0003). Overcoming these challenges is crucial for the reliable operation of the mixed-reality environment and its rehabilitation tasks.</p><p class='provenance'><strong>Provenance:</strong> MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1</p></section>
<section class='insight'><h3>i0003 · Confidence 0.80</h3><p><strong>Summary:</strong> The project&#x27;s adaptive controller and logging system are designed to provide sophisticated, data-driven rehabilitation adjustments.</p><p>Work Package 3 focuses on creating an adaptive controller and logging system to manage task parameters and feedback fading (c0004). This system is intended to achieve high logging rates and provide rolling summaries of performance metrics, while actively mitigating issues like overreactive difficulty oscillations and metric drift (c0004). Although the evidence touches upon feedback mechanisms and adaptive adjustments, it does not fully elaborate on the specifics of how these adaptive features are implemented or validated (c0002). The goal is to create a responsive system that precisely tailors the rehabilitation experience to each patient&#x27;s needs.</p><p class='provenance'><strong>Provenance:</strong> MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2</p></section>

          <tr><td>c0001</td><td>The NeuroReach VR system aims to train stroke patients in reach and grasp movements using an ARAT-aligned pouring task and an MX Ink tracing task. This system provides visual, auditory, and haptic feedback to enhance selective muscle activation in the arms, crucial for stroke rehabilitation. The project utilizes a Quest 3S headset with Shared Spatial Anchors for its mixed-reality capabilities. The tasks are designed to be intuitive and motivating, with potential for clinical application in stroke recovery.</td><td>Supported</td><td>Auto-approved (review disabled).</td><td>MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1</td></tr>
<tr><td>c0002</td><td>A projected dashboard will display metrics such as on path, tilt window, spills proxy, RMS error, and SPARC, updated per trial. This real-time data allows for observation of adaptive difficulty adjustments and fading feedback, tailored to the user&#x27;s muscle activation. The system&#x27;s adaptive controller will adjust parameters like the corridor, tilt window, and tracing tunnel based on performance. Feedback will transition from knowledge of performance to knowledge of results as the user progresses.</td><td>Supported</td><td>Auto-approved (review disabled).</td><td>MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2</td></tr>
<tr><td>c0003</td><td>Challenges include anchor drift, noisy tilt estimation, and inconsistent haptic support, which are being addressed through specific solutions. Solutions for anchor drift involve relocalizing anchors at the session start, and low-pass filtering and debouncing events are used for tilt estimation. The project aims to deliver a Unity project with anchors and passthrough, a functional MX Ink tracing sample with haptic ticks, and a one-tap calibration UI. Alternative approaches considered include using fiducials instead of anchors and running tracing tasks without haptics if support is inconsistent.</td><td>Supported</td><td>Auto-approved (review disabled).</td><td>MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1</td></tr>
<tr><td>c0004</td><td>Work Package 2 focuses on building the Passthrough Pouring task and the MX Ink Tracing task, incorporating visual elements like neon halos and virtual liquid particles. This package also includes the integration of multimodal feedback mechanisms to enhance the user experience. Work Package 3 is dedicated to developing an adaptive controller and logging system, responsible for rule-based adaptation of task parameters and feedback fading. The adaptive controller aims to achieve logging rates between 50 to 90 Hz with rolling summaries, while addressing challenges like overreactive difficulty oscillation and metric drift.</td><td>Supported</td><td>Auto-approved (review disabled).</td><td>MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2</td></tr>

      <h2>Suggested Actions & Next Hypotheses</h2>
      <section class='action'><h4>Deep Dive into Adaptive Controller Logic and Feedback Fading · Clarification</h4><p>The current claims mention an adaptive controller and feedback fading (c0002, c0004), but lack specific details on the algorithms, rules, and thresholds governing these adaptive adjustments. To fully understand the system&#x27;s sophistication and potential clinical impact, a deeper exploration of the adaptive controller&#x27;s logic and the precise mechanisms of feedback fading is required.</p></section>
<section class='action'><h4>Quantify the Impact of Specific Technical Solutions on System Stability · Hypothesis</h4><p>While claim c0003 identifies solutions for anchor drift and noisy tilt estimation, the evidence does not quantify the effectiveness of these solutions. A hypothesis is that these solutions significantly improve system stability and reduce the impact of these challenges. Further investigation is needed to measure the reduction in anchor drift and improvement in tilt estimation accuracy post-implementation.</p></section>
<section class='action'><h4>Validate Real-time Dashboard Metrics and Trial-by-Trial Updates · NextStep</h4><p>Claim c0002 states that a projected dashboard will display specific metrics updated per trial. However, the evidence only partially lists these metrics and does not confirm their real-time update frequency or accuracy. A next step is to verify the complete list of dashboard metrics and confirm that they are indeed updated in real-time for each trial, providing immediate feedback to clinicians and patients.</p></section>
<section class='action'><h4>Elaborate on the Clinical Application and User Experience of Adaptive Feedback · Clarification</h4><p>Claim c0001 suggests potential clinical application, and c0002 mentions adaptive difficulty adjustments and fading feedback. However, the specific ways in which these adaptive features will be tailored to different stroke patient profiles and how they contribute to a motivating and effective user experience are not fully detailed. Further clarification is needed on how the adaptive controller&#x27;s output translates into tangible benefits for stroke rehabilitation and patient engagement.</p></section>
<section class='action'><h4>Confirm Scope and Completion of Unity Project Deliverables · NextStep</h4><p>Claim c0003 outlines specific deliverables for the Unity project, including a functional MX Ink tracing sample with haptic ticks and a one-tap calibration UI. The evidence does not confirm the completion or the exact scope of these deliverables. A crucial next step is to obtain confirmation and potentially demonstrations of these specific Unity project components to validate the project&#x27;s progress and readiness.</p></section>
