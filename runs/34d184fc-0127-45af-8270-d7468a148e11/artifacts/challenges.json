    "claim_text": "The system aims to train stroke patients in reach and grasp movements using an ARAT-aligned pouring task and an MX Ink tracing task. It incorporates visual, auditory, and haptic feedback to enhance the rehabilitation process. The goal is to improve selective muscle activation in the arms, which is crucial for stroke recovery. The system is being developed as a proof-of-concept using a Quest 3S headset with Shared Spatial Anchors.",
    "summary": "The claim states the system aims to improve selective muscle activation, but the evidence primarily focuses on task completion metrics and feedback mechanisms, not direct muscle activation measurement.",
    "detail": "The claim explicitly mentions the goal of improving 'selective muscle activation in the arms'. However, the provided evidence snippets detail the system's features and demonstration plan, which include metrics like 'on path, tilt window, spills proxy, RMS error and SPARC' (E1) and 'knowledge of performance to knowledge of results' feedback (E2). While E1 mentions 'adaptive difficulty and fading feedback based on the user\u2019s muscle activation', it doesn't elaborate on how this muscle activation is measured or directly improved. The optional Myo Armband extension (E1) suggests EMG biofeedback for wrist extension, which is a step towards measuring muscle activity, but it's presented as an optional extension and not a core part of the initial system's stated goal of improving selective muscle activation. Therefore, there's a gap in explaining how the core system directly addresses and measures the improvement of selective muscle activation.",

We compute on path, time in tilt\nwindow, spill proxy and smoothness with SPARC, and adapt difficulty to keep the user in a target corridor.\nRationale: The design draws on motor learning and control theory, emphasizing that stroke recovery combines\nadaptation and skill learning to achieve specific task goals [5]. Guided by optimal feedback control, path corri-\ndors, goal halos, and error-contingent cues support goal-directed corrections.
