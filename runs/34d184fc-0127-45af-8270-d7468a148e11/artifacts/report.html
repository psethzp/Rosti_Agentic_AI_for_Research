      <section class='insight'><h3>i0001 · Confidence 0.90</h3><p><strong>Summary:</strong> The system leverages AR-based tasks and multimodal feedback to facilitate stroke patient rehabilitation, with a focus on improving motor control and engagement.</p><p>The rehabilitation system is designed to train stroke patients in reach and grasp movements through AR-aligned pouring and tracing tasks, incorporating visual, auditory, and haptic feedback (c0001). This multimodal feedback, alongside gamified elements and a projected dashboard displaying performance metrics, aims to enhance user intuitiveness and motivation (c0002). While the ultimate goal is to improve selective muscle activation (c0001), the current evidence primarily details task completion metrics and feedback mechanisms, with a need for clearer demonstration of direct muscle activation measurement (c0001).</p><p class='provenance'><strong>Provenance:</strong> MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov (1) p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov (1) p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov (1) p2</p></section>
<section class='insight'><h3>i0002 · Confidence 0.85</h3><p><strong>Summary:</strong> Technical challenges related to AR stability and feedback consistency are being addressed through specific engineering solutions and adaptive control mechanisms.</p><p>Significant technical hurdles exist, including anchor drift and inconsistent haptic support, which could compromise the system&#x27;s reliability (c0001). Solutions are being implemented, such as relocalizing anchors and employing filtering for tilt data (c0003). Furthermore, the system incorporates an adaptive controller designed to adjust task parameters and feedback based on user performance, moving from knowledge of performance to knowledge of results (c0002, c0004). This adaptive approach aims to enhance the rehabilitation experience by dynamically tailoring the challenge and feedback.</p><p class='provenance'><strong>Provenance:</strong> MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov (1) p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov (1) p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov (1) p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov (1) p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov (1) p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov (1) p1</p></section>
<section class='insight'><h3>i0003 · Confidence 0.95</h3><p><strong>Summary:</strong> The system&#x27;s development is structured into distinct work packages, focusing on task creation, multimodal feedback integration, and advanced adaptive control.</p><p>The development process is organized into specific work packages, with Work Package 2 dedicated to building the core AR tasks, including the Passthrough Pouring and MX Ink Tracing tasks, and integrating visual and haptic feedback (c0004). Work Package 3 focuses on the sophisticated adaptive controller and logging system, which will implement rule-based adaptation of task parameters and feedback fading (c0004).

      <h2>Suggested Actions & Next Hypotheses</h2>
      <section class='action'><h4>Directly Measure and Correlate Muscle Activation with Task Performance · NextStep</h4><p>The core claim is to improve selective muscle activation, yet the evidence focuses on task completion metrics and feedback. A critical next step is to integrate direct muscle activation measurement (e.g., using EMG sensors) and establish a clear correlation between these measurements and the system&#x27;s performance metrics (e.g., RMS error, SPARC). This will validate the system&#x27;s primary therapeutic goal.</p></section>
<section class='action'><h4>Investigate the Impact of Anchor Drift on Rehabilitation Efficacy · Hypothesis</h4><p>Anchor drift is identified as a significant technical challenge. A hypothesis to explore is whether the degree of anchor drift directly impacts the effectiveness of the rehabilitation tasks and the patient&#x27;s ability to learn and improve motor control. This would involve quantifying drift during sessions and correlating it with patient progress and feedback consistency.</p></section>
<section class='action'><h4>Clarify the Specifics of Adaptive Difficulty and Fading Feedback Based on Muscle Activation · Clarification</h4><p>The system claims adaptive difficulty and fading feedback are based on muscle activation. However, the evidence is vague. A clarification is needed on *how* muscle activation data will be interpreted and translated into specific adjustments for parameters like corridor width, tilt window, and feedback fading. What are the thresholds and algorithms involved?.</p></section>
<section class='action'><h4>Validate the Reliability of Projected Dashboard Metrics in Real-World Scenarios · NextStep</h4><p>The projected dashboard is described with specific metrics. A next step is to conduct user testing to validate that these metrics are reliably captured and accurately reflect the patient&#x27;s performance and progress, especially in the presence of potential technical challenges like anchor drift and noisy tilt estimation. This includes confirming that all mentioned metrics (on path, tilt window, spills proxy, RMS error, SPARC) are indeed captured and displayed.</p></section>
<section class='action'><h4>Explore the Long-Term Efficacy of Gamified AR Rehabilitation for Stroke Patients · Hypothesis</h4><p>While the system is designed to be intuitive and motivational through gamification, a forward-looking hypothesis is to investigate the long-term adherence and sustained therapeutic benefits of this AR-based approach compared to traditional stroke rehabilitation methods. This would involve longitudinal studies to assess patient engagement and functional recovery over extended periods.</p></section>
