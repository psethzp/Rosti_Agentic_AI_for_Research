    "detail": "The core claim is to improve selective muscle activation, yet the evidence focuses on task completion metrics and feedback. A critical next step is to integrate direct muscle activation measurement (e.g., using EMG sensors) and establish a clear correlation between these measurements and the system's performance metrics (e.g., RMS error, SPARC). This will validate the system's primary therapeutic goal.",

    "detail": "Anchor drift is identified as a significant technical challenge. A hypothesis to explore is whether the degree of anchor drift directly impacts the effectiveness of the rehabilitation tasks and the patient's ability to learn and improve motor control. This would involve quantifying drift during sessions and correlating it with patient progress and feedback consistency.",

A clarification is needed on *how* muscle activation data will be interpreted and translated into specific adjustments for parameters like corridor width, tilt window, and feedback fading.

A next step is to conduct user testing to validate that these metrics are reliably captured and accurately reflect the patient's performance and progress, especially in the presence of potential technical challenges like anchor drift and noisy tilt estimation. This includes confirming that all mentioned metrics (on path, tilt window, spills proxy, RMS error, SPARC) are indeed captured and displayed.",
