    "detail": "The adaptive controller and feedback fading mechanisms are described as key features, but their effectiveness and the proposed solutions for overreactive oscillations and metric drift require further validation. A pilot study or controlled experiment is needed to demonstrate that these adaptive features genuinely improve rehabilitation outcomes and prevent negative side effects.",

A pilot study with stroke survivors is essential to assess the system's intuitiveness, motivational aspects, and actual impact on motor control and functional recovery, directly addressing the lack of clinical validation.",

Further clarification is needed on the dashboard's development status and the precise calculation of each metric, especially in relation to the adaptive features.",
