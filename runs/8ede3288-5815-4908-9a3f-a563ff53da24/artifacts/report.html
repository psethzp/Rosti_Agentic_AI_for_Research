      <section class='insight'><h3>i0001 · Confidence 0.95</h3><p><strong>Summary:</strong> The NeuroReach VR system is a proof-of-concept mixed-reality application designed for stroke rehabilitation, focusing on enhancing arm motor control through engaging, adaptive tasks and feedback mechanisms.</p><p>The NeuroReach VR system leverages mixed reality to create an intuitive and motivational environment for stroke survivors to improve arm motor control and functional recovery (c0001, d0001). It incorporates gamified elements and tasks like pouring and tracing, aligned with rehabilitation goals (c0001, d0001). The system is in its early proof-of-concept stage, with a focus on developing core functionalities and technical aspects for use with the Quest 3S headset (d0001, d0005). While promising, its clinical effectiveness and readiness for widespread application are not yet proven, and significant technical challenges remain (c0001, c0004, d0005).</p><p class='provenance'><strong>Provenance:</strong> MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, r0001 p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, r0007 p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2</p></section>
<section class='insight'><h3>i0002 · Confidence 0.90</h3><p><strong>Summary:</strong> The system employs adaptive difficulty and feedback fading to personalize the rehabilitation experience, though the implementation and validation of these features are ongoing and face technical hurdles.</p><p>A key feature of the NeuroReach VR system is its adaptive controller, which dynamically adjusts task difficulty based on user performance to prevent overreactive oscillations and metric drift (c0002, d0002). The system also incorporates feedback mechanisms that transition from knowledge of performance to knowledge of results as the user progresses (c0002, d0002). However, the detailed implementation and effectiveness of these adaptive features are still under development and require further validation (d0002). Challenges related to the system&#x27;s ability to adapt difficulty and fade feedback are acknowledged, indicating this aspect is still being refined (c0001).</p><p class='provenance'><strong>Provenance:</strong> MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, r0003 p1, r0002 p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1</p></section>
<section class='insight'><h3>i0003 · Confidence 0.98</h3><p><strong>Summary:</strong> Technical challenges, including spatial anchor drift, noisy sensor data, and inconsistent haptic support, are being actively addressed to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the mixed-reality feedback and tracking.</p><p>Significant technical challenges are present in the development of the NeuroReach VR system, notably anchor drift and noisy tilt estimation, which directly impact the accuracy of real-time feedback (c0003, d0003). Inconsistent haptic support is another identified hurdle (c0003, d0003). Solutions such as relocalizing anchors at session start, low-pass filtering for tilt estimation, and event debouncing are being implemented (c0003, d0003). Alternative approaches, like using fiducials, are being considered if current solutions prove insufficient, highlighting the ongoing effort to overcome these technical limitations (c0003, d0003).</p><p class='provenance'><strong>Provenance:</strong> MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p1, r0007 p1</p></section>
<section class='insight'><h3>i0004 · Confidence 0.85</h3><p><strong>Summary:</strong> A projected dashboard is planned to provide real-time performance metrics, crucial for observing the system&#x27;s adaptive capabilities, though its comprehensive display and integration are still under development.</p><p>The NeuroReach VR system intends to feature a projected dashboard that will display key performance metrics in real-time, such as &#x27;on path&#x27;, &#x27;tilt window&#x27;, &#x27;spills proxy&#x27;, &#x27;RMS error&#x27;, and &#x27;SPARC&#x27; (d0004). These metrics are vital for observing the adaptive difficulty and feedback fading mechanisms in action (d0004). While some metrics are outcomes of specific tasks like pouring and tracing, the dashboard&#x27;s comprehensive display and real-time updates are still under development (d0004). The claim mentions this dashboard, but the evidence primarily lists some metrics as task outcomes, indicating the dashboard&#x27;s full functionality is not yet realized (c0002).</p><p class='provenance'><strong>Provenance:</strong> MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, r0004 p1, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2, MR_Proposal_Purkayastha_Elsig_Flueckiger_Khoshimov p2</p></section>
