DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT\nGoal: To build NeuroReach VR \u2013 a proof-of-concept mixed-reality system that trains stroke reach and grasp using\nan ARAT-aligned pouring task [1] and an MX Ink tracing task with visual, auditory and haptic feedback [6], to\nimprove selective muscle activation in the arms for stroke rehabilitation. [2].\nIdea: Quest 3S with Shared Spatial Anchors pins virtual halos to a real cup and jug while MX Ink provides stylus\npose and pressure for tracing with haptic ticks via Unity SendHapticImpulse. We compute on path, time in tilt\nwindow, spill proxy and smoothness with SPARC, and adapt difficulty to keep the user in a target corridor.\nRationale: The design draws on motor learning and control theory, emphasizing that stroke recovery combines\nadaptation and skill learning to achieve specific task goals [5]. Guided by optimal feedback control, path corri-\ndors, goal halos, and error-contingent cues support goal-directed corrections. Task-specific ADL movements with\nvalidated kinematic metrics use SPARC for smoothness, while conservative auditory pacing maintains performance\nconsistency [3].\nII. WORK PACKAGES AND TIMELINE\nHardware & Software: The system runs on Meta Quest 3S using Logitech MX Ink for precision input and haptic\nfeedback, with an optional Myo armband for EMG biofeedback. It is developed in Unity (C#) for Android, logs\ndata in CSV and JSON formats, and uses Python notebooks for quick analysis and visualization.\nWork Package 1 : Data Anchors, Integration and Calibration (Weeks 1\u20132)\nMembers Responsible: R. Khoshimov, A. Elsig\nDescription: Set up Quest 3 passthrough and Spatial Anchors; integrate MX Ink input and haptics; implement\nCSV logger. Outcomes: Unity project with anchors and passthrough; MX Ink tracing sample running with haptic\nticks; one tap calibration UI. Challenges: Anchor drift; noisy tilt estimation; inconsistent haptic support. Solutions:\nRelocalize anchors at session start; low pass tilt and debounce events;.

OUTCOMES AND DEMONSTRATION\nExpected outcomes: (i) A working proof-of-concept prototype that turns kinematics into adaptive multimodal\nfeedback during pouring and tracing (ii) A logging and analytics tool that summarizes on path, tilt window, spills\nproxy and SPARC smoothness (iii) A small pilot indicating increased time in tilt window and reduced RMS path\nerror with improved SPARC, consistent with drinking task kinematics and smoothness literature [5].\nEvaluation plans: (i) A preliminary usability study with physiotherapists, collecting qualitative feedback through a\nthink-aloud protocol and post-session questionnaires. (ii) Assess the system\u2019s perceived effectiveness, ease of use,\nand fit to ARAT aligned tasks, with specific focus on clarity of halos, ticks and result cards (iii) Focus on the\nintuitiveness of the feedback mechanisms and the motivational aspect of the gamified environment, with potential\nfor clinical application.\nDemonstration plan: (i) Live on-headset demo with quick anchor calibration, where user performs two one minute\npouring blocks and two tracing blocks with real time halos, ticks and error bars (ii) Projected dashboard shows\non path, tilt window, spills proxy, RMS error"

    "claim_text": "The system features an adaptive controller that adjusts task difficulty, such as the corridor, tilt window, and tracing tunnel, based on user performance. Feedback mechanisms are designed to fade from providing knowledge of performance to knowledge of results as the user progresses. A projected dashboard will display real-time metrics like on path, tilt window, spills proxy, RMS error, and SPARC to observe adaptive difficulty and feedback fading. This adaptive approach aims to prevent overreactive difficulty oscillations and metric drift across sessions by using solutions like moving averages.",

    "detail": "The claim (c0002) states that a 'projected dashboard will display real-time metrics like on path, tilt window, spills proxy, RMS error, and SPARC to observe adaptive difficulty and feedback fading.' Evidence E1 and E2 mention some of these metrics as outcomes of the pouring and tracing tasks, such as 'on path, tilt window and spill proxy' (E1) and 'on path, time in tilt window, spill proxy' (E2). However, neither snippet describes a 'projected dashboard' or confirms that these metrics are displayed in real-time for the purpose of observing adaptive difficulty and feedback fading. The existence and functionality of the dashboard, as well as the inclusion of metrics like RMS error and SPARC on this dashboard, remain unverified by the provided evidence.",

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT\nGoal: To build NeuroReach VR \u2013 a proof-of-concept mixed-reality system that trains stroke reach and grasp using\nan ARAT-aligned pouring task [1] and an MX Ink tracing task with visual, auditory and haptic feedback [6], to\nimprove selective muscle activation in the arms for stroke rehabilitation. [2].\nIdea: Quest 3S with Shared Spatial Anchors pins virtual halos to a real cup and jug while MX Ink provides stylus\npose and pressure for tracing with haptic ticks via Unity SendHapticImpulse. We compute on path, time in tilt\nwindow, spill proxy and smoothness with SPARC, and adapt difficulty to keep the user in a target corridor.\nRationale: The design draws on motor learning and control theory, emphasizing that stroke recovery combines\nadaptation and skill learning to achieve specific task goals [5]. Guided by optimal feedback control, path corri-\ndors, goal halos, and error-contingent cues support goal-directed corrections. Task-specific ADL movements with\nvalidated kinematic metrics use SPARC for smoothness, while conservative auditory pacing maintains performance\nconsistency [3].\nII. WORK PACKAGES AND TIMELINE\nHardware & Software: The system runs on Meta Quest 3S using Logitech MX Ink for precision input and haptic\nfeedback, with an optional Myo armband for EMG biofeedback. It is developed in Unity (C#) for Android, logs\ndata in CSV and JSON formats, and uses Python notebooks for quick analysis and visualization.\nWork Package 1 : Data Anchors, Integration and Calibration (Weeks 1\u20132)\nMembers Responsible: R. Khoshimov, A. Elsig\nDescription: Set up Quest 3 passthrough and Spatial Anchors; integrate MX Ink input and haptics; implement\nCSV logger.
