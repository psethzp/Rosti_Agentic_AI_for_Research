    "detail": "While claims c0001 and i0001 highlight the goal of improving selective muscle activation in arms for stroke rehabilitation, there's a lack of detail on the underlying neurological principles or how the system's feedback mechanisms (visual, auditory, haptic) specifically address common neurological deficits post-stroke. Clarifying this will strengthen the clinical rationale.",

A hypothesis could be formed that specific ranges or patterns of adaptive difficulty adjustments (e.g., corridor width, tilt window) directly correlate with observable improvements in specific stroke recovery milestones (e.g., range of motion, force generation, functional independence). This would bridge the gap between technical adaptation and clinical outcomes.",

To address this, a next step is to define and integrate specific clinical outcome measures (e.g., Fugl-Meyer Assessment, ARAT scores) into the project's evaluation framework, moving beyond metrics like 'on path' or 'RMS error' mentioned in c0002 and c0004. This will provide evidence of actual rehabilitation efficacy.",

However, stroke rehabilitation often involves a broader range of motor deficits, including trunk control, balance, and lower limb function. A forward-looking action could be to hypothesize how the NeuroReach VR system's core principles (mixed reality, adaptive feedback, gamification) could be extended or adapted to address these other critical areas of stroke recovery.",
