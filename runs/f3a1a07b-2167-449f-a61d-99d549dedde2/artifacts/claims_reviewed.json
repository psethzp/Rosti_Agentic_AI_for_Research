Mixed modelling \nFor all outcomes (cognitive performance, HRQoL and sleep) we \nconsidered the data from all participants who completed at least three \nassessments on three different days. We analysed the association be\u00ad\ntween each of the three markers of RF-EMF exposure on three endpoints \nusing a mixed modelling approach, adjusting for age and sex, and with \nrandom intercepts for each individual, thereby taking into account the \nsystematic differences between individuals in cognitive performance, \nHRQoL and sleep habits. We chose a linear approach considering there is \nno established dose-response relationship, between the exposure and \nany of the evaluated health outcomes, and as such no indication for \nthreshold effects, plateaus, or other non-linear behavior that would \njustify choosing a more complicated (and likely less interpretable) \nmodel.

An alternative explanation is an influence \nfrom sleep deprivation through longer waking hours due to the time \nspent on the devices, and consecutive delayed sleep onset (Van den \nBulck, 2007), which then may impair cognitive performance and cause \nsymptoms such as fatigue and exhaustion.

Because of this, the World Health Organization \n(WHO) has recently identified cognitive function, sleep and several \nhealth-related quality of life symptoms as priority topics for systematic \nreview (R\u00a8o\u00a8osli et al., 2021; Verbeek et al., 2021; Benke et al., 2022; \nBosch-Capblanch et al., 2022). \nCognitive function is typically considered as a mental process that \ninvolves a range of domains including learning, memory, reasoning, \nproblem solving, decision making and attention (Benke et al., 2022). \nSeveral previous research studies have observed effects on cognitive \nfunction in association with localized exposure of the head to radio \nfrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) (Curcio, 2018, Ishihara, \nYamazaki et al. 2020).

A recent study from Switzerland found indications that high \nEMF exposure is negatively associated with figural visuo-spatial skills, \nwhich are processed on the right side of the brain, but not verbal skills, \nlocated on the left side (Schoeni et al., 2015).

In randomized double-blind human \nexperimental studies, mostly no acute effect of RF-EMF exposure was \nobserved in general population samples or in individuals stating to react \nto EMF (Schmiedchen et al., 2019). In epidemiological studies and \npopulation surveys, extensive mobile phone and/or e-media use was \noften found to be related to reduced HRQoL including a wide range of \nsymptoms including behavioural problems, hearing loss, headaches, \nfatigue, concentration and stress (Chetty-Mhlanga, Fuhrimann et"

It was not feasible to assess exposure in real-time, or ask \nparticipants on a daily basis about multiple time frames of exposure, side \nof use, distance to the head, hands-free use, for all possible devices. Our \nchoice to assess RF-EMF exposure metrics in the 4-h period prior to \nhealth assessments was based on the maximum time frame typical \nhuman laboratory studies on short-term effects have considered \n(Bosch-Capblanch et al., 2022). We acknowledge that there is no \nestablished lag time for the effect\u2019s onset, or typical duration of effect, \nwhich may have resulted in bias to the mean (explaining a lack of effect). \nIn addition, duration of calls and screen time are likely to be crude \nproxies of the actual RF-EMF dose (Calder\u00b4on et al., 2022), which further \ndepends on the connectivity, as well as phone characteristics (e.g. Spe\u00ad\ncific Absorption Rate) and the frequency of the used service (Mazloum, \nAerts et al. 2019).

Yet, studies targeted to separate biophysical effects from RF-EMF \nexposure from other non-physical related pathways such as addiction or \nnight-time use indicate that RF-EMF exposure is the least likely cause \n(Roser et al., 2016; Schoeni et al., 2016; Schoeni et al., 2017, Auvinen, \nFeychting et al. 2019, Guxens, Vermeulen et al. 2019) \nRegarding effects on sleep, several studies -rather consistently-point \nto changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha frequency range, \nboth awake (Danker-Hopfe et al., 2019; Wallace and Selmaoui, 2019) \nand while asleep (Regel et al., 2007) associated with RF-EMF exposure. \nIt is possible that such changes could affect working memory and \nmemory consolidation (Frenda and Fenn, 2016).

Nevertheless, despite the \nsmall sample size, the finding of a significant adverse association be\u00ad\ntween screen time and stress, and tendencies towards a worse mood and \nreduced fatigue (although not significant) make associations between \nscreen time and HRQoL less likely to be due to chance findings. \nAnother limitation is exposure misclassification: we have a good idea \nabout day-to-day variability in exposure due to cordless phone calls, \nmobile phone calls and data traffic using the own mobile phone, we \nacknowledge that there are other sources of RF-EMF radiation which \nwere not assessed as part of this study (e.g. environmental sources, and \nusage of personal communication devices such as tablets and laptops, \ntelevisions).

While the claim mentions that some studies have found associations between mobile phone calls and specific cognitive tasks, and that extensive e-media use is associated with reduced health-related quality of life (including fatigue and stress), other evidence suggests a lack of consistent findings. Specifically, one study did not find consistent directions of effect or significant associations between short-term RF-EMF exposure markers and cognitive performance or HRQoL (E14). Another study found fourteen associations in agreement with a pattern of phone use on the right decreasing spatial memory and phone use on the left decreasing verbal memory, but ten contradicting it, most non-significant (E1). Furthermore, previous systematic reviews have concluded a lack of evidence for negative influences of RF-EMF on attention and cognitive function (E19). This creates a contradiction in the overall understanding of the impact of mobile phone use."

Because of this, the World Health Organization \n(WHO) has recently identified cognitive function, sleep and several \nhealth-related quality of life symptoms as priority topics for systematic \nreview (R\u00a8o\u00a8osli et al., 2021; Verbeek et al., 2021; Benke et al., 2022; \nBosch-Capblanch et al., 2022). \nCognitive function is typically considered as a mental process that \ninvolves a range of domains including learning, memory, reasoning, \nproblem solving, decision making and attention (Benke et al., 2022). \nSeveral previous research studies have observed effects on cognitive \nfunction in association with localized exposure of the head to radio \nfrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) (Curcio, 2018, Ishihara, \nYamazaki et al. 2020). The real-life short-term implications on cognitive \nperformance and health-related quality of life have not been well \nstudied. A recent study from Switzerland found indications that high \nEMF exposure is negatively associated with figural visuo-spatial skills, \nwhich are processed on the right side of the brain, but not verbal skills, \nlocated on the left side (Schoeni et al., 2015). This finding was replicated \nin an independent sample (Foerster et al., 2018), and is currently eval\u00ad\nuated in a cohort of adolescents from the UK (Toledano et al., 2019). \nSeveral studies have previously looked at RF-EMF exposure in rela\u00ad\ntion to non-specific physical symptoms like headaches, dizziness, con\u00ad\ncentration difficulties and anxiety. In randomized double-blind human \nexperimental studies, mostly no acute effect of RF-EMF exposure was \nobserved in general population samples or in individuals stating to react \nto EMF (Schmiedchen et al., 2019). In epidemiological studies and \npopulation surveys, extensive mobile phone and/or e-media use was \noften found to be related to reduced HRQoL including a wide range of \nsymptoms including behavioural problems, hearing loss, headaches, \nfatigue, concentration and stress (Chetty-Mhlanga, Fuhrimann et"
