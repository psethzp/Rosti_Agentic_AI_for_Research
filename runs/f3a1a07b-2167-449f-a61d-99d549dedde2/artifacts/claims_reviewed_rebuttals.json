Yet, studies targeted to separate biophysical effects from RF-EMF \nexposure from other non-physical related pathways such as addiction or \nnight-time use indicate that RF-EMF exposure is the least likely cause \n(Roser et al., 2016; Schoeni et al., 2016; Schoeni et al., 2017, Auvinen, \nFeychting et al. 2019, Guxens, Vermeulen et al. 2019) \nRegarding effects on sleep, several studies -rather consistently-point \nto changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha frequency range, \nboth awake (Danker-Hopfe et al., 2019; Wallace and Selmaoui, 2019) \nand while asleep (Regel et al., 2007) associated with RF-EMF exposure. \nIt is possible that such changes could affect working memory and \nmemory consolidation (Frenda and Fenn, 2016).

The small sample size, however, may be a limitation for the \ngeneralizability of our findings.

Nevertheless, despite the \nsmall sample size, the finding of a significant adverse association be\u00ad\ntween screen time and stress, and tendencies towards a worse mood and \nreduced fatigue (although not significant) make associations between \nscreen time and HRQoL less likely to be due to chance findings. \nAnother limitation is exposure misclassification: we have a good idea \nabout day-to-day variability in exposure due to cordless phone calls, \nmobile phone calls and data traffic using the own mobile phone, we \nacknowledge that there are other sources of RF-EMF radiation which \nwere not assessed as part of this study (e.g. environmental sources, and \nusage of personal communication devices such as tablets and laptops, \ntelevisions).

While the claim mentions that some studies have found associations between mobile phone calls and specific cognitive tasks, and that extensive e-media use is associated with reduced health-related quality of life (including fatigue and stress), other evidence suggests a lack of consistent findings. Specifically, one study did not find consistent directions of effect or significant associations between short-term RF-EMF exposure markers and cognitive performance or HRQoL (E14). Another study found fourteen associations in agreement with a pattern of phone use on the right decreasing spatial memory and phone use on the left decreasing verbal memory, but ten contradicting it, most non-significant (E1). Furthermore, previous systematic reviews have concluded a lack of evidence for negative influences of RF-EMF on attention and cognitive function (E19). This creates a contradiction in the overall understanding of the impact of mobile phone use."

Because of this, the World Health Organization \n(WHO) has recently identified cognitive function, sleep and several \nhealth-related quality of life symptoms as priority topics for systematic \nreview (R\u00a8o\u00a8osli et al., 2021; Verbeek et al., 2021; Benke et al., 2022; \nBosch-Capblanch et al., 2022). \nCognitive function is typically considered as a mental process that \ninvolves a range of domains including learning, memory, reasoning, \nproblem solving, decision making and attention (Benke et al., 2022). \nSeveral previous research studies have observed effects on cognitive \nfunction in association with localized exposure of the head to radio \nfrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) (Curcio, 2018, Ishihara, \nYamazaki et al. 2020). The real-life short-term implications on cognitive \nperformance and health-related quality of life have not been well \nstudied. A recent study from Switzerland found indications that high \nEMF exposure is negatively associated with figural visuo-spatial skills, \nwhich are processed on the right side of the brain, but not verbal skills, \nlocated on the left side (Schoeni et al., 2015). This finding was replicated \nin an independent sample (Foerster et al., 2018), and is currently eval\u00ad\nuated in a cohort of adolescents from the UK (Toledano et al., 2019). \nSeveral studies have previously looked at RF-EMF exposure in rela\u00ad\ntion to non-specific physical symptoms like headaches, dizziness, con\u00ad\ncentration difficulties and anxiety. In randomized double-blind human \nexperimental studies, mostly no acute effect of RF-EMF exposure was \nobserved in general population samples or in individuals stating to react \nto EMF (Schmiedchen et al., 2019). In epidemiological studies and \npopulation surveys, extensive mobile phone and/or e-media use was \noften found to be related to reduced HRQoL including a wide range of \nsymptoms including behavioural problems, hearing loss, headaches, \nfatigue, concentration and stress (Chetty-Mhlanga, Fuhrimann et"
