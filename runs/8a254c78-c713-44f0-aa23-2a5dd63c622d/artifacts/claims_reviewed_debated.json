While environmental contributions \nfrom base stations and radio masts contribute to personal exposure, most \nof the dose experienced by the general population is a direct result of \nnear-field sources, such as mobile phones, laptops, tablets, WiFi and \ncordless phones which are used close to the body (Cabr\u00b4e-Riera et al., \n2020; van Wel et al., 2021; Eeftens et al., 2023).

Similar studies also reported no or heterogeneous effects, both \non the long-term (Cabr\u00b4e-Riera et al., 2021) and on the short-term in \ncontrolled exposure settings (Verrender et al., 2016; Vecsei et al., 2018). \nWe found that increased screen time was associated with a small \ntentative decrease in mood and fatigue, and a significant increase in self- \nreported stress level, consistent with previous studies (Cain and Gradi\u00ad\nsar, 2010, Davies et al., 2012; Lacy, Allender et al. 2012; Tang et al., \n2021). While the effect size per 10-min increment was small, we note \nthat the typical interquartile range contrast is much larger for screen \ntime than for calls (either cordless or mobile). On average, participants \nspent 40 min (IQR 24.5\u201368.8 min) looking at the screens of their phones \nwithin the 4 h prior to assessment. The effect of an interquartile range \nincrement in exposure is therefore accordingly larger. Interestingly, no \nsuch effect was present for either cordless or mobile phone calls. Similar \neffects of screen time on HRQoL, especially in combination with lack of \nphysical activity have been shown also in previous studies (Davies et al., \n2012; Lacy, Allender et al. 2012). In line with these studies, we noticed a \nsignificant increase in mood when people reported spending more time \noutside that day.

Normalized \nscores were calculated by subtracting the test-specific average score and \ndividing by the test-specific standard deviation. We expressed all asso\u00ad\nciations as a percentage change in normalized test scores. The scores for \nthe six individual tests, as well as all visuo-spatial and all verbal tests \ncombined were modelled as a function of the three exposure markers, \nwhich the participant experienced prior to taking the test. We adjusted \nfor coffee and alcohol consumption, time spent outside, type of day \n(workday/non-workday), sleep duration the night before and the \nlearning effect after completing the tests multiple times, following a \ncubic b-spline trend. We studied the association between the three \nmarkers of RF-EMF exposure verbal and visuo-spatial performance.

Mixed modelling \nFor all outcomes (cognitive performance, HRQoL and sleep) we \nconsidered the data from all participants who completed at least three \nassessments on three different days. We analysed the association be\u00ad\ntween each of the three markers of RF-EMF exposure on three endpoints \nusing a mixed modelling approach, adjusting for age and sex, and with \nrandom intercepts for each individual, thereby taking into account the \nsystematic differences between individuals in cognitive performance, \nHRQoL and sleep habits. We chose a linear approach considering there is \nno established dose-response relationship, between the exposure and \nany of the evaluated health outcomes, and as such no indication for \nthreshold effects, plateaus, or other non-linear behavior that would \njustify choosing a more complicated (and likely less interpretable) \nmodel. We considered that there might be a substitution effect (where \nparticipants can only engage in a single exposure related activity at any \none time (cordless phone calls, mobile phone calls, or screen time). In \naddition, we therefore analysed the associations with all phone calls, \nand of the sum of all three exposure markers.

Cognitive \nperformance was measured through six \u201cgame-like\u201d tests, assessing verbal and visuo-spatial performance \nrepeatedly. HRQoL was assessed as fatigue, mood and stress on a Likert-scale (1\u201310). Sleep duration and effi\u00ad\nciency was measured using activity trackers. We fitted mixed models with random intercepts per participant on \ncognitive, HRQoL and sleep scores.

The study reported a reduction in fatigue (-0.03 points) and mood (-0.03 points) for every 10-minute increase in mobile phone screen time in the 4 hours prior to assessment. However, the confidence intervals for these changes (-0.07 to 0.00 for fatigue and -0.06 to 0.00 for mood) indicate that these results were not statistically significant. This means that the observed changes could be due to random chance rather than a true effect of screen time."

Moreover, their stress increased by approxi\u00ad\nmately the same number of points: 0.03 (95% CI: 0.00, 0.06), which was \nstatistically significant. The association found for the combined expo\u00ad\nsure to cordless and mobile calls were similar to that found for mobile \ncalls, but attenuated. Similarly, we found attenuated associations for all \nthree RF-EMF exposure markers combined, similar to those found for \nscreen time (OS Table 2). \n4.3. Associations with sleep duration & quality \nOut of 121 participants, 105 participants registered at least 3 and up \nto 13 nights of sleep, totaling 918 nights. Table 4 shows the total time in \nbed, total time asleep, sleep efficiency, and the duration of the four sleep \nstages (deep, light, REM and awake). Sleep duration and quality metrics \nwere generally positively correlated with each other, except for the \nduration lying awake (versus all other metrics) and the duration of deep \nsleep versus light sleep (OS Fig. 2D), and OS Fig. 7 shows the day-to-day \nvariability by assessment number. Compared to women, men spent less \ntime asleep (\u221221 min (95% CI: \u221243, \u22126 min), and had reduced sleep \nefficiency (\u22121.3% (95%-CI: \u22122.1%, \u22120.4%)) and REM sleep (\u221211.0% \n(95% CI: \u221221.4%, \u22120.6%)). Participants spent 0.30 min (95% CI: 0.16, \n0.45 min) more lying awake with each year they aged. \nFig. 3 shows the associations between the various sleep outcomes \nlisted and self-reported phone use the day before. We did not find any \nconsistent directions of effect or significant associations across the \ndifferent exposure markers or outcomes. Adjusted and unadjusted effect \nestimates were very similar (Fig. 3), and no associations were found \neither when we summed duration of exposure to cordless and mobile \nphone calls, or all three exposure markers"

        "chunk_text": "the study include its relatively small sample size of \n121 individuals, which is further reduced to 101 or 105 by missing data \nfor exposure and time-varying confounders for the different outcomes. \nWe performed a priori power calculations assuming cognitive effects \nsimilar to those found by Foerster et al. (2018) (Foerster et al., 2018), \nwho found a 2.6% decrease in verbal memory and a 3.9% decrease in \nspatial memory for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in exposure. \nWe further assumed similar exposure contrasts and a learning effect of \n2% over 10 days, which indicated that a minimum of 100 participants \nwould be needed to reach 80% power. While the recruitment target was \nreached, the study may still have been underpowered to detect possible \neffects smaller than those assumed in the power calculation. We note \nthat we analysed repeated observations, which increases the statistical \npower compared to a conventional analysis of between-subject vari\u00ad\nability. The small sample size, however, may be a limitation for the \ngeneralizability of our findings. While we found sporadic significant \nassociations with the RF-EMF exposure markers, these were few in \nnumber and not consistent across multiple cognitive tests or between \ndifferent exposure markers. Given that false positive rate is 5%, six \nsignificant findings among 72 associations between exposure and \ncognitive test results and zero significant associations among 21 sleep \nanalyses are compatible with chance findings. Nevertheless, despite the \nsmall sample size, the finding of a significant adverse association be\u00ad\ntween screen time and stress, and tendencies towards a worse mood and \nreduced fatigue (although not significant) make associations between \nscreen time and HRQoL less likely to be due to chance findings. \nAnother limitation is exposure misclassification: we have a good idea \nabout day-to-day variability in exposure due to cordless phone calls, \nmobile phone calls and data traffic using the own mobile phone, we \nacknowledge that there are other sources of RF-EMF radiation which \nwere not assessed as part of this study (e.g. environmental sources, and \nusage of personal communication devices such as tablets and laptops, \ntelevisions). It was not feasible to assess exposure in real-time, or ask \nparticipants"

The study notes that mobile phone web surfing, which generates relatively little RF-EMF exposure, showed an association with mood, while calls involving higher RF-EMF exposure did not. This suggests that the observed effects are unlikely to be due to RF-EMF exposure and points towards non-biophysical mechanisms. However, the specific non-biophysical pathways, such as the influence of sleep deprivation or psychological arousal from media content, are discussed as potential explanations but not definitively proven."
