    "detail": "Given that non-physical pathways like addiction or night-time use are suggested to be more influential than RF-EMF exposure (c0002, d0001, d0004), and that screen time is linked to stress (c0001, d0001, d0003), a deeper investigation into how specific phone usage patterns (e.g., social media scrolling, gaming, late-night use) impact sleep quality and subsequent psychological well-being is warranted. This could involve qualitative research or more detailed quantitative tracking of usage types.",
