Given that false positive rate is 5%, six \nsignificant findings among 72 associations between exposure and \ncognitive test results and zero significant associations among 21 sleep \nanalyses are compatible with chance findings. Nevertheless, despite the \nsmall sample size, the finding of a significant adverse association be\u00ad\ntween screen time and stress, and tendencies towards a worse mood and \nreduced fatigue (although not significant) make associations between \nscreen time and HRQoL less likely to be due to chance findings. \nAnother limitation is exposure misclassification: we have a good idea \nabout day-to-day variability in exposure due to cordless phone calls, \nmobile phone calls and data traffic using the own mobile phone, we \nacknowledge that there are other sources of RF-EMF radiation which \nwere not assessed as part of this study (e.g. environmental sources, and \nusage of personal communication devices such as tablets and laptops, \ntelevisions).

In epidemiological studies and \npopulation surveys, extensive mobile phone and/or e-media use was \noften found to be related to reduced HRQoL including a wide range of \nsymptoms including behavioural problems, hearing loss, headaches, \nfatigue, concentration and stress (Chetty-Mhlanga, Fuhrimann et al. \n2020). Yet, studies targeted to separate biophysical effects from RF-EMF \nexposure from other non-physical related pathways such as addiction or \nnight-time use indicate that RF-EMF exposure is the least likely cause \n(Roser et al., 2016; Schoeni et al., 2016; Schoeni et al., 2017, Auvinen, \nFeychting et al. 2019, Guxens, Vermeulen et al. 2019) \nRegarding effects on sleep, several studies -rather consistently-point \nto changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha frequency range, \nboth awake (Danker-Hopfe et al., 2019; Wallace and Selmaoui, 2019) \nand while asleep (Regel et al., 2007) associated with RF-EMF exposure. \nIt is possible that such changes could affect working memory and \nmemory consolidation (Frenda and Fenn, 2016). Nevertheless, many \nstudies so far indicated no association between RF-EMF exposure and \nself-reported sleep quality (Tettamanti et al., 2020). \nThe SPUTNIC study (Study Panel on Upcoming Technologies to \nstudy Non-Ionizing radiation and Cognition) aimed to investigate the \nassociation between exposure to RF-EMF resulting from the use of mo\u00ad\nbile phones and cognitive performance (verbal as well as visuo-spatial \nskills), health-related quality of life and sleep quality, which are \npotentially associated with these exposures. We aim to see if we can \nreproduce the association between RF-EMF exposure and visuo-spatial \nskills (Schoeni et al., 2015, Foerster et al., 2018). We will further \ninvestigate whether we find a similar amplified association looking at \nright-handed individuals, as was found in previous studies (Schoeni \net al., 2015, Foerster et al., 2018), and whether the opposite is \u2013again- \ntrue for verbal skills. This paper describes the results of a panel study in \n121 adults on RF-EMF exposure markers and cognitive performance, as \nassessed through six innovative \u201cgame-like\u201d tasks, which each of the \nparticipants completed repeatedly. \n2.

This study did not confirm a \nsimilar pattern. There were fourteen associations in agreement with this \npattern and ten contradicting it, most non-significant (Fig. 1, OS \nTable 1). Similar studies also reported no or heterogeneous effects, both \non the long-term (Cabr\u00b4e-Riera et al., 2021) and on the short-term in \ncontrolled exposure settings (Verrender et al., 2016; Vecsei et al., 2018). \nWe found that increased screen time was associated with a small \ntentative decrease in mood and fatigue, and a significant increase in self- \nreported stress level, consistent with previous studies (Cain and Gradi\u00ad\nsar, 2010, Davies et al., 2012; Lacy, Allender et al. 2012; Tang et al., \n2021). While the effect size per 10-min increment was small, we note \nthat the typical interquartile range contrast is much larger for screen \ntime than for calls (either cordless or mobile). On average, participants \nspent 40 min (IQR 24.5\u201368.8 min) looking at the screens of their phones \nwithin the 4 h prior to assessment. The effect of an interquartile range \nincrement in exposure is therefore accordingly larger. Interestingly, no \nsuch effect was present for either cordless or mobile phone calls. Similar \neffects of screen time on HRQoL, especially in combination with lack of \nphysical activity have been shown also in previous studies (Davies et al., \n2012; Lacy, Allender et al. 2012). In line with these studies, we noticed a \nsignificant increase in mood when people reported spending more time \noutside that day.

This study did not confirm a \nsimilar pattern. There were fourteen associations in agreement with this \npattern and ten contradicting it, most non-significant (Fig. 1, OS \nTable 1). Similar studies also reported no or heterogeneous effects, both \non the long-term (Cabr\u00b4e-Riera et al., 2021) and on the short-term in \ncontrolled exposure settings (Verrender et al., 2016; Vecsei et al., 2018). \nWe found that increased screen time was associated with a small \ntentative decrease in mood and fatigue, and a significant increase in self- \nreported stress level, consistent with previous studies (Cain and Gradi\u00ad\nsar, 2010, Davies et al., 2012; Lacy, Allender et al. 2012; Tang et al., \n2021). While the effect size per 10-min increment was small, we note \nthat the typical interquartile range contrast is much larger for screen \ntime than for calls (either cordless or mobile).
