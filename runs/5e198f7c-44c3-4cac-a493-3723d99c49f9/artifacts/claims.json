DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT\nGoal: To build NeuroReach VR \u2013 a proof-of-concept mixed-reality system that trains stroke reach and grasp using\nan ARAT-aligned pouring task [1] and an MX Ink tracing task with visual, auditory and haptic feedback [6], to\nimprove selective muscle activation in the arms for stroke rehabilitation. [2].\nIdea: Quest 3S with Shared Spatial Anchors pins virtual halos to a real cup and jug while MX Ink provides stylus\npose and pressure for tracing with haptic ticks via Unity SendHapticImpulse. We compute on path, time in tilt\nwindow, spill proxy and smoothness with SPARC, and adapt difficulty to keep the user in a target corridor.\nRationale: The design draws on motor learning and control theory, emphasizing that stroke recovery combines\nadaptation and skill learning to achieve specific task goals [5]. Guided by optimal feedback control, path corri-\ndors, goal halos, and error-contingent cues support goal-directed corrections. Task-specific ADL movements with\nvalidated kinematic metrics use SPARC for smoothness, while conservative auditory pacing maintains performance\nconsistency [3].\nII. WORK PACKAGES AND TIMELINE\nHardware & Software: The system runs on Meta Quest 3S using Logitech MX Ink for precision input and haptic\nfeedback, with an optional Myo armband for EMG biofeedback. It is developed in Unity (C#) for Android, logs\ndata in CSV and JSON formats, and uses Python notebooks for quick analysis and visualization.\nWork Package 1 : Data Anchors, Integration and Calibration (Weeks 1\u20132)\nMembers Responsible: R. Khoshimov, A. Elsig\nDescription: Set up Quest 3 passthrough and Spatial Anchors; integrate MX Ink input and haptics; implement\nCSV logger. Outcomes: Unity project with anchors and passthrough; MX Ink tracing sample running with haptic\nticks; one tap calibration UI. Challenges: Anchor drift; noisy tilt estimation; inconsistent haptic support. Solutions:\nRelocalize anchors at session start; low pass tilt and debounce events;. Alternatives: Use fiducials instead of anchors;\nrun tracing without haptics.\nWork Package 2 : VR Task and Multimodal Feedback (Weeks"
