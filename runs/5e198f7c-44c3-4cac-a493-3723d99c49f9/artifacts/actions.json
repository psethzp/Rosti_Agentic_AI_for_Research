    "detail": "While c0001 states the system aims to improve selective muscle activation, the current evidence (c0001, i0001) focuses on the system's design and technical development. A crucial next step is to design and conduct studies that directly measure and validate the improvement in selective muscle activation in stroke survivors using the NeuroReach VR system. This would involve defining specific metrics for 'selective muscle activation' and demonstrating their improvement through the system's use.",

    "detail": "Challenge c0002 highlights a discrepancy between the claim of adaptive difficulty based on muscle activation and the evidence which details adaptation based on performance metrics and feedback fading (c0002). Further clarification is needed on how muscle activation data is captured, processed, and translated into adaptive difficulty adjustments within the system. This could involve detailing the specific sensors used and the algorithms that link muscle activation levels to changes in task parameters.",

A forward-looking hypothesis is that the gamified environment, intuitive feedback, and adaptive nature of the system (c0002, c0003) will lead to sustained user engagement and improved long-term rehabilitation outcomes for stroke survivors. Future research should aim to test this hypothesis through longitudinal studies.",

A next step is to investigate how the adaptive controller, as described in c0003, functions as a cohesive unit to dynamically adjust rehabilitation parameters based on user performance. This would involve evaluating its effectiveness in providing a personalized and progressive rehabilitation experience beyond individual component optimizations.",

A clarification is needed on the specific types of biofeedback (e.g., visual, auditory, haptic) that are directly linked to and designed to enhance selective muscle activation. Understanding these specific mechanisms will be crucial for assessing the system's targeted therapeutic approach.",
