    "detail": "The system's adaptive controller can lead to overreactive difficulty oscillation (c0003). Further research is needed to understand how this oscillation affects stroke patients' motivation, frustration levels, and the effectiveness of motor learning. This could involve user studies to observe behavioral responses and qualitative feedback.",

    "detail": "The system employs feedback fading from knowledge of performance to knowledge of results (c0002). However, the specific parameters and timing of this fading process are not detailed. We hypothesize that there are optimal rates and thresholds for feedback fading that will lead to more robust and generalized motor skill acquisition in stroke survivors. This could be tested by varying the fading speed and observing long-term retention of learned movements.",

It is unclear how this specific outcome is measured and what metrics are used to demonstrate improvement.
