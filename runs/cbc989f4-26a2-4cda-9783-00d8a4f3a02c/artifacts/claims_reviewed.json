Mixed modelling \nFor all outcomes (cognitive performance, HRQoL and sleep) we \nconsidered the data from all participants who completed at least three \nassessments on three different days. We analysed the association be\u00ad\ntween each of the three markers of RF-EMF exposure on three endpoints \nusing a mixed modelling approach, adjusting for age and sex, and with \nrandom intercepts for each individual, thereby taking into account the \nsystematic differences between individuals in cognitive performance, \nHRQoL and sleep habits. We chose a linear approach considering there is \nno established dose-response relationship, between the exposure and \nany of the evaluated health outcomes, and as such no indication for \nthreshold effects, plateaus, or other non-linear behavior that would \njustify choosing a more complicated (and likely less interpretable) \nmodel. We considered that there might be a substitution effect (where \nparticipants can only engage in a single exposure related activity at any \none time (cordless phone calls, mobile phone calls, or screen time). In \naddition, we therefore analysed the associations with all phone calls, \nand of the sum of all three exposure markers.

An alternative explanation is an influence \nfrom sleep deprivation through longer waking hours due to the time \nspent on the devices, and consecutive delayed sleep onset (Van den \nBulck, 2007), which then may impair cognitive performance and cause \nsymptoms such as fatigue and exhaustion. We adjusted for sleep dura\u00ad\ntion of the previous night but cannot rule out an impact from chronic \nsleep deprivation not captured by day-to-day variation. Sleep quality \nmight also be impaired as a result of the psychological and somatic \narousal and cognitive over-activation through the media content (Cain \nand Gradisar, 2010). We evaluated stress as an outcome, but cannot \nexclude that it may be (in addition) a mediator or moderator for un\u00ad\nmeasured effects or other endpoints. Due to small sample size, we were \nnot able to perform these analyses formally. \nWe did not find any consistent associations between markers of RF- \nEMF exposure and sleep duration and quality. This is consistent with \nseveral other previous studies, which have noted differences in EEG \n(Curcio et al., 2005; Regel et al., 2007), but no reduction in sleep \nduration or quality (Regel et al., 2007; Eggert et al., 2020). \nStrengths of the study include its repeated study design and the high \nnumber of repeated observations per individual, which allowed us to \nstudy the day-to-day variability both in exposure and the various health \nendpoints, on the short term.

In epidemiological studies and \npopulation surveys, extensive mobile phone and/or e-media use was \noften found to be related to reduced HRQoL including a wide range of \nsymptoms including behavioural problems, hearing loss, headaches, \nfatigue, concentration and stress (Chetty-Mhlanga, Fuhrimann et al. \n2020). Yet, studies targeted to separate biophysical effects from RF-EMF \nexposure from other non-physical related pathways such as addiction or \nnight-time use indicate that RF-EMF exposure is the least likely cause \n(Roser et al., 2016; Schoeni et al., 2016; Schoeni et al., 2017, Auvinen, \nFeychting et al. 2019, Guxens, Vermeulen et al. 2019) \nRegarding effects on sleep, several studies -rather consistently-point \nto changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha frequency range, \nboth awake (Danker-Hopfe et al., 2019; Wallace and Selmaoui, 2019) \nand while asleep (Regel et al., 2007) associated with RF-EMF exposure. \nIt is possible that such changes could affect working memory and \nmemory consolidation (Frenda and Fenn, 2016). Nevertheless, many \nstudies so far indicated no association between RF-EMF exposure and \nself-reported sleep quality (Tettamanti et al., 2020). \nThe SPUTNIC study (Study Panel on Upcoming Technologies to \nstudy Non-Ionizing radiation and Cognition) aimed to investigate the \nassociation between exposure to RF-EMF resulting from the use of mo\u00ad\nbile phones and cognitive performance (verbal as well as visuo-spatial \nskills), health-related quality of life and sleep quality, which are \npotentially associated with these exposures. We aim to see if we can \nreproduce the association between RF-EMF exposure and visuo-spatial \nskills (Schoeni et al., 2015, Foerster et al., 2018). We will further \ninvestigate whether we find a similar amplified association looking at \nright-handed individuals, as was found in previous studies (Schoeni \net al., 2015, Foerster et al., 2018), and whether the opposite is \u2013again- \ntrue for verbal skills.

This study did not confirm a \nsimilar pattern. There were fourteen associations in agreement with this \npattern and ten contradicting it, most non-significant (Fig. 1, OS \nTable 1). Similar studies also reported no or heterogeneous effects, both \non the long-term (Cabr\u00b4e-Riera et al., 2021) and on the short-term in \ncontrolled exposure settings (Verrender et al., 2016; Vecsei et al., 2018). \nWe found that increased screen time was associated with a small \ntentative decrease in mood and fatigue, and a significant increase in self- \nreported stress level, consistent with previous studies (Cain and Gradi\u00ad\nsar, 2010, Davies et al., 2012; Lacy, Allender et al. 2012; Tang et al., \n2021).

It was not feasible to assess exposure in real-time, or ask \nparticipants on a daily basis about multiple time frames of exposure, side \nof use, distance to the head, hands-free use, for all possible devices. Our \nchoice to assess RF-EMF exposure metrics in the 4-h period prior to \nhealth assessments was based on the maximum time frame typical \nhuman laboratory studies on short-term effects have considered \n(Bosch-Capblanch et al., 2022). We acknowledge that there is no \nestablished lag time for the effect\u2019s onset, or typical duration of effect, \nwhich may have resulted in bias to the mean (explaining a lack of effect). \nIn addition, duration of calls and screen time are likely to be crude \nproxies of the actual RF-EMF dose (Calder\u00b4on et al., 2022), which further \ndepends on the connectivity, as well as phone characteristics (e.g. Spe\u00ad\ncific Absorption Rate) and the frequency of the used service (Mazloum, \nAerts et al. 2019).

However, to estimate duration of \nuse for the last 4 h is substantially less demanding than life-time use as \nrequested in epidemiological studies on long term effects. Moreover, \nsince exposure information was provided before doing the test and \nknowing the test performance, we do not expect differential exposure \nmisclassification. \n6.

Cognitive performance \nTest scores were calculated for each participant, for each day, and for \neach of six cognitive tests (focussed on either left or right brain tasks). \nWe calculated normalized the test scores in order to be able to present all \ntests on the same scale, and to enable the combined analysis of the three \nverbal tests, and similarly for the three visuo-spatial tests. Normalized \nscores were calculated by subtracting the test-specific average score and \ndividing by the test-specific standard deviation. We expressed all asso\u00ad\nciations as a percentage change in normalized test scores. The scores for \nthe six individual tests, as well as all visuo-spatial and all verbal tests \ncombined were modelled as a function of the three exposure markers, \nwhich the participant experienced prior to taking the test. We adjusted \nfor coffee and alcohol consumption, time spent outside, type of day \n(workday/non-workday), sleep duration the night before and the \nlearning effect after completing the tests multiple times, following a \ncubic b-spline trend. We studied the association between the three \nmarkers of RF-EMF exposure verbal and visuo-spatial performance. In \naddition, we stratified the analysis for participants who used their phone \non the right side, and those who used their phone on the left side or on \nboth sides, and thus experienced exposure from calls primarily on the \ndifferent sides of the head. \n2.6.2. Health-related quality of life \nScores related to sleepiness, stress and mood were all assessed and \nanalysed on a continuous scale between 1 and 10, as a function of the \nthree RF-EMF exposure markers, adjusting for coffee and alcohol con\u00ad\nsumption, time spent outside, type of day (workday versus non- \nworkday), sleep duration the night before. \n2.6.3. Sleep duration and quality \nSleep duration and efficiency were evaluated on a continuous scale \nas a function of the three RF-EMF exposure markers. We adjusted for \ntime-varying confounders coffee and alcohol consumption and time \nspent outside the day before and type of day (workday/non-workday). \n2.6.4.
