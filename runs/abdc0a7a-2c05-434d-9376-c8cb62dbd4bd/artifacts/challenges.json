Despite the efforts of various\nresearch communities to address multilingualism fairness for\nAI technologies, there is still much room for improvement.\nLastly, the unfairness related to financial means for access-\ning, training and maintaining large language models may need\nto be regulated by governmental organisations with the aim\nto provide equity-oriented means to all educational entities\ninterested in using these modern technologies. Without fair\naccess, this AI technology may seriously widen the education\ngap like no other technology before it.\nWe therefore conclude with UNESCO\u2019s call to ensure that\nAI does not widen the technological and educational divides\nwithin and between countries, and recommended important\nstrategies for the use of AI in a responsible and fair way to\nreduce this existing gap instead.

In addition, the following studies\nexamined NLP-based models for generating automatic adap-\ntive feedback: Zhu et al.

The ability of LLMs to generate human-like text raises concerns about academic integrity, as evidenced by issues like plagiarism in the age of generative AI. Educational institutions must proactively address these risks by educating students about the potential societal biases and ethical considerations associated with AI applications. The integration of LLMs into education requires careful consideration of their limitations and the development of strategies to mitigate risks, such as bias and unfairness.",

    "detail": "Evidence E3 directly supports the claim that learners may rely too heavily on LLMs, leading to a negative impact on critical thinking and problem-solving skills due to the effortless acquisition of information. However, the claim also mentions the need for educational institutions to proactively address these risks. While E3 suggests awareness and E4 suggests using LLMs as a supplement, the practical implementation and effectiveness of these mitigation strategies in truly counteracting the potential negative impact on cognitive skills remain an unanswered question.",
