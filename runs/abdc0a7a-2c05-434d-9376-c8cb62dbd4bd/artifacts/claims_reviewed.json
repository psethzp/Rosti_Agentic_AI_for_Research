Introduction\nLarge language models, such as GPT-3 [1], have made signifi-\ncant advancements in natural language processing (NLP) in\nrecent years. These models are trained on massive amounts\nof text data and are able to generate human-like text, answer\nquestions, and complete other language-related tasks with\nhigh accuracy.\nOne key development in the area is the use of trans-\nformer architectures [2, 3] and the underlying attention mech-\nanism [4], which have greatly improved the ability of auto-\nregressive1 self-supervised2 language models to handle long-\n1Auto-regressive because the model uses its previous predictions as input\nfor new predictions.\n2Self-supervised because they learn from the data itself, rather than being\nexplicitly provided with correct answers as in supervised learning.\nrange dependencies in natural-language texts. The transformer\narchitecture, introduced in [4], uses the self-attention mecha-\nnism to determine the relevance of different parts of the input\nwhen generating predictions. This allows the model to better\nunderstand the relationships between words in a sentence, re-\ngardless of their position.\nAnother important development is the use of pre-training,\nwhere a model is first trained on a large dataset before being\nfine-tuned on a specific task. This has proven to be an effec-\ntive technique for improving performance on a wide range of\nlanguage tasks [5]. For example, BERT [2] is a pre-trained\ntransformer-based encoder model that can be fine-tuned on\nvarious NLP tasks, such as sentence classification, question\nanswering and named entity recognition. In fact, the so-called\nfew-shot learning capability of large language models to be"

They can\nbe used to improve the clarity of the teaching materials, locate\ninformation or resources that professionals may be in need for\nas they learn on the job, as well as used for on-the-job training\nmodules that require presentation and communication skills.\nFor assessment and evaluation, teachers can use large\nlanguage models to semi-automate the grading of student work\nby highlighting potential strengths and weakness of the work\nin question, e.g., essays, research papers, and other writing\nassignments. This can save teachers a significant amount of\ntime for tasks related to individualized feedback to students.\nFurthermore, large language models can also be used to check\nfor plagiarism, which can help to prevent cheating. Hence,\nlarge language models can help teachers to identify areas\nwhere students are struggling, which adds to a more accurate\nassessments of student learning development and challenges.\nTargeted instruction provided by the models can be used to\nhelp students excel and to provide opportunities for further\ndevelopment.\nThe acquaintance of students with AI challenges related\nto the potential bias in the output, the need for continuous hu-\nman oversight, and the potential for misuse of large language\nmodels are not unique to education.

Additionally,\nextensive research has been conducted on fine-tuning these\nmodels on smaller datasets and applying transfer learning to\nnew problems. This allows for improved performance on\nspecific tasks with smaller amount of data.\nWhile large language models have made great strides in\nrecent years, there are still many limitations that need to be\naddressed. One major limitation is the lack of interpretabil-\nity, as it is difficult to understand the reasoning behind the\nmodel\u2019s predictions. There are ethical considerations, such\nas concerns about bias and the impact of these models, e.g.,\non employment, risks of misuse and inadequate or unethical\ndeployment, loss of integrity, and many more.
