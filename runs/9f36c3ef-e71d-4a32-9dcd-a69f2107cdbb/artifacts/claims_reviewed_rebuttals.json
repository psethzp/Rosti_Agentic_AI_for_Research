DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT\nGoal: To build NeuroReach VR \u2013 a proof-of-concept mixed-reality system that trains stroke reach and grasp using\nan ARAT-aligned pouring task [1] and an MX Ink tracing task with visual, auditory and haptic feedback [6], to\nimprove selective muscle activation in the arms for stroke rehabilitation. [2].\nIdea: Quest 3S with Shared Spatial Anchors pins virtual halos to a real cup and jug while MX Ink provides stylus\npose and pressure for tracing with haptic ticks via Unity SendHapticImpulse. We compute on path, time in tilt\nwindow, spill proxy and smoothness with SPARC, and adapt difficulty to keep the user in a target corridor.\nRationale: The design draws on motor learning and control theory, emphasizing that stroke recovery combines\nadaptation and skill learning to achieve specific task goals [5]. Guided by optimal feedback control, path corri-\ndors, goal halos, and error-contingent cues support goal-directed corrections. Task-specific ADL movements with\nvalidated kinematic metrics use SPARC for smoothness, while conservative auditory pacing maintains performance\nconsistency [3].\nII. WORK PACKAGES AND TIMELINE\nHardware & Software: The system runs on Meta Quest 3S using Logitech MX Ink for precision input and haptic\nfeedback, with an optional Myo armband for EMG biofeedback. It is developed in Unity (C#) for Android, logs\ndata in CSV and JSON formats, and uses Python notebooks for quick analysis and visualization.\nWork Package 1 : Data Anchors, Integration and Calibration (Weeks 1\u20132)\nMembers Responsible: R. Khoshimov, A. Elsig\nDescription: Set up Quest 3 passthrough and Spatial Anchors; integrate MX Ink input and haptics; implement\nCSV logger. Outcomes: Unity project with anchors and passthrough; MX Ink tracing sample running with haptic\nticks; one tap calibration UI. Challenges: Anchor drift; noisy tilt estimation; inconsistent haptic support. Solutions:\nRelocalize anchors at session start; low pass tilt and debounce events;.

Evidence E2 details significant challenges in the mixed-reality implementation, including 'Anchor drift,' 'noisy tilt estimation,' and 'inconsistent haptic support.' These issues directly affect the core functionalities of the system, such as guiding users through pouring and tracing tasks. If anchors drift, the virtual elements may not align correctly with the real environment, and noisy tilt estimation could lead to inaccurate feedback. Inconsistent haptic support would diminish the multimodal feedback crucial for an intuitive and motivational experience. The proposed solutions like 'Relocalize anchors at session start' and 'low pass tilt and debounce events' are mentioned, but their efficacy in a real-world rehabilitation setting with stroke patients is not yet demonstrated."

The claim (c0002) states that a projected dashboard will display metrics such as 'on path, tilt window, spills proxy, RMS error, and SPARC', updated per trial. Evidence E1 mentions 'on path, time in tilt window, spill proxy' as being computed. Evidence E2 mentions 'on path, tilt window and spill proxy' as outcomes of the pouring task and 'tracing with tunnel and live error' for the tracing task. However, 'RMS error' and 'SPARC' are not explicitly mentioned in the provided evidence snippets. Therefore, the completeness of the dashboard's metrics as described in the claim is not fully substantiated."
