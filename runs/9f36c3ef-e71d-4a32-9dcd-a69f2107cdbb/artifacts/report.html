      <section class='insight'><h3>i0001 · Confidence 1.00</h3><p><strong>Summary:</strong> The system employs a mixed-reality approach with specific tasks and feedback mechanisms to enhance stroke rehabilitation.</p><p>The rehabilitation system is designed as a proof-of-concept mixed-reality platform utilizing a Quest 3S headset and Shared Spatial Anchors to improve selective muscle activation in the arms for stroke patients. It incorporates two primary tasks: an ARAT-aligned pouring task and an MX Ink tracing task, both enhanced with visual elements like neon halos and virtual particles, and the tracing task includes haptic ticks for feedback. The system integrates visual, auditory, and haptic feedback to guide users and make the rehabilitation experience intuitive and motivational, with the ultimate goal of clinical application. A one-tap calibration UI is also included for ease of use.

<section class='insight'><h3>i0002 · Confidence 0.90</h3><p><strong>Summary:</strong> Adaptive control and performance monitoring are key features, but face challenges in implementation and accuracy.</p><p>The system incorporates a rule-based adaptive controller that adjusts task difficulty, such as the corridor and tracing tunnel, based on user performance. Feedback gradually transitions from knowledge of performance to knowledge of results as the user progresses. A projected dashboard displays real-time metrics like &#x27;on path&#x27; and &#x27;tilt window,&#x27; updated per trial, allowing for observation of adaptive difficulty and fading feedback. However, challenges exist in preventing overreactive difficulty oscillations and metric drift across sessions, with proposed solutions like moving averages.

<section class='insight'><h3>i0003 · Confidence 1.00</h3><p><strong>Summary:</strong> Technical challenges in mixed-reality implementation, particularly with spatial anchors and sensor data, require robust solutions.</p><p>Several technical challenges are identified that could impact the system&#x27;s usability and effectiveness in guiding users through tasks like pouring and tracing. These include potential anchor drift, noisy tilt estimation, and inconsistent haptic support. Proposed solutions involve relocalizing anchors at the session start, applying low-pass filtering and debouncing to tilt estimation, and considering alternatives like fiducials or omitting haptics if primary solutions are insufficient. These issues directly affect the accuracy and reliability of the mixed-reality guidance.

      <h2>Suggested Actions & Next Hypotheses</h2>
      <section class='action'><h4>Investigate the efficacy of proposed solutions for adaptive control stability · Clarification</h4><p>The evidence acknowledges challenges with overreactive difficulty oscillation and metric drift across sessions (c0001, d0003). While solutions like moving averages with gates and floors are proposed (d0003), the specific implementation and empirical validation of these solutions for the pouring and tracing tasks are not detailed. Further investigation is needed to confirm if these methods effectively prevent oscillations and drift in the context of the ARAT-aligned pouring and MX Ink tracing tasks.</p></section>
<section class='action'><h4>Hypothesize the impact of anchor drift mitigation on user experience · Hypothesis</h4><p>Relocalizing anchors at session start is proposed to address anchor drift (c0003, d0002). However, the frequency and intrusiveness of this relocalization process are not specified. It&#x27;s hypothesized that frequent or complex relocalization could disrupt the user&#x27;s flow and negatively impact the motivational aspect of the rehabilitation (c0001, d0004). Future work should explore user feedback on the relocalization process.</p></section>
<section class='action'><h4>Develop a comprehensive dashboard visualization strategy · NextStep</h4><p>The projected dashboard is intended to display various metrics (c0002, d0004). While some metrics are listed, the evidence does not fully detail the dashboard&#x27;s design or how it will visually represent the adaptive difficulty and fading feedback in a way that is intuitive and motivational for users (d0004). A next step should be to design and prototype the dashboard, focusing on clear and actionable visualizations of these key performance indicators and adaptive changes.</p></section>
<section class='action'><h4>Clarify the relationship between tilt estimation solutions and metric drift · Clarification</h4><p>There appears to be a discrepancy or lack of clarity regarding the solutions for tilt estimation and metric drift. &#x27;Noisy tilt estimation&#x27; is mentioned with a solution of low-pass filtering (c0003, d0002), while &#x27;metric drift across sessions&#x27; is addressed with moving averages (d0003). It&#x27;s unclear if noisy tilt estimation directly contributes to metric drift and if the proposed solutions are complementary or independent. Clarification is needed on how these technical challenges are interconnected and how the proposed solutions address them holistically.</p></section>
