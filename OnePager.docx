Collective Insight Lab

Challenge Tackled
Problem: Research synthesis is time-consuming and error-prone. Researchers struggle to verify claims across multiple papers and often miss contradictions or key connections.
User: Students, researchers, and analysts who need to quickly understand what a collection of papers says about a specific topic with verifiable citations.
Solution: Collective Insight Lab – a multi-agent AI system where specialized agents collaborate to read, critique, and synthesize research papers. Each insight is backed by exact citations with page numbers and quotes, ensuring verifiability.

Tools / ML Models Used
Python- programming language
gemini – Multi-agent reasoning, synthesis, embeddings
ChromaDB – Vector storage for document chunks
FastAPI, Jinja2 - Webserver + Templating
HTMX, Tailwind, Pdf.js - Website
Server Send Events  - Incremental data updates 

What Worked Well
Multi-Agent Pipeline: Four specialized agents (Researcher → Reviewer → Team Red → Synthesizer) successfully collaborate through a stateful workflow
Citation Verification: implemented exact quote matching with character-level offsets, achieving high precision
Modular Architecture: Clear separation of concerns across ingestion, retrieval, agents, and validation modules and UI Layer

What Was Challenging
Challenge 1: Agent Layer and UI Layer synchronisation
Solution: Tried to define a shared data contract to allow parallel development of the agent and UI layer.
Challenge 2: Time Constraints
Solution: Focused on MVP core loop first, deferred MCP for interoperability

How We Spent Our Time
0–3h: Architecture planning, repository setup, schema design
3–6h: PDF ingestion pipeline, ChromaDB integration, embedding generation
6–12h: Different agent setup and basic integration 
12–16h: Agent LLM integration 
16–20h: UI setup, planning and implementation 
20–24h: UI integration, end-to-end testing, submission materials
