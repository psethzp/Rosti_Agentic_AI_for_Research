Introduction\nLarge language models, such as GPT-3 [1], have made signifi-\ncant advancements in natural language processing (NLP) in\nrecent years. These models are trained on massive amounts\nof text data and are able to generate human-like text, answer\nquestions, and complete other language-related tasks with\nhigh accuracy.\nOne key development in the area is the use of trans-\nformer architectures [2, 3] and the underlying attention mech-\nanism [4], which have greatly improved the ability of auto-\nregressive1 self-supervised2 language models to handle long-\n1Auto-regressive because the model uses its previous predictions as input\nfor new predictions.\n2Self-supervised because they learn from the data itself, rather than being\nexplicitly provided with correct answers as in supervised learning.\nrange dependencies in natural-language texts. The transformer\narchitecture, introduced in [4], uses the self-attention mecha-\nnism to determine the relevance of different parts of the input\nwhen generating predictions. This allows the model to better\nunderstand the relationships between words in a sentence, re-\ngardless of their position.\nAnother important development is the use of pre-training,\nwhere a model is first trained on a large dataset before being\nfine-tuned on a specific task. This has proven to be an effec-\ntive technique for improving performance on a wide range of\nlanguage tasks [5]. For example, BERT [2] is a pre-trained\ntransformer-based encoder model that can be fine-tuned on\nvarious NLP tasks, such as sentence classification, question\nanswering and named entity recognition.

Additionally,\nextensive research has been conducted on fine-tuning these\nmodels on smaller datasets and applying transfer learning to\nnew problems. This allows for improved performance on\nspecific tasks with smaller amount of data.\nWhile large language models have made great strides in\nrecent years, there are still many limitations that need to be\naddressed. One major limitation is the lack of interpretabil-\nity, as it is difficult to understand the reasoning behind the\nmodel\u2019s predictions. There are ethical considerations, such\nas concerns about bias and the impact of these models, e.g.,\non employment, risks of misuse and inadequate or unethical\ndeployment, loss of integrity, and many more. Overall, large\nlanguage models will continue to push the boundaries of what\nis possible in natural language processing. However, there\nis still much work to be done in terms of addressing their\nlimitations and the related ethical considerations.\n1.1 Opportunities for Learning\nThe use of large language models in education has been iden-\ntified as a potential area of interest due to the diverse range of\napplications they offer. Through the utilization of these mod-\nels, opportunities for enhancement of learning and teaching\nexperiences may be possible for individuals at all levels of edu-\ncation, including primary, secondary, tertiary and professional\ndevelopment.\nFor elementary school students, large language models\ncan assist in the development of reading and writing skills\n(e.g., by suggesting syntactic and grammatical corrections), as\nwell as in the development of writing style and critical think-\ning skills. These models can be used to generate questions\nand prompts that encourage students to think critically about\nwhat they are reading and writing, and to analyze and inter-\npret the information presented to them. Additionally, large\nlanguage models can also assist in the development of reading\ncomprehension skills by providing students with summaries\nand explanations of complex texts, which can make reading\nand understanding the material easier.\nFor middle and high school students, large language\nmodels can assist in the learning of a language and of writ-\ning styles for various subjects and topics, e.g., mathematics,\nphysics, language and literature, and other subjects. These\nmodels can be used to generate practice problems and quizzes,\nwhich can help students to better understand, contextual-\nize and retain the material they are learning. Additionally,\nlarge language models can also assist in the development of\nproblem-solving skills by providing students with explana-\ntions, step-by-step solutions, and interesting related questions\nto problems, which can help them to understand the reasoning\nbehind the solutions and develop analytical and out-of-the-box\nthinking.\nFor university students, large language models can assist\nin the research and writing tasks, as well as in the development\nof critical thinking and problem-solving skills. These models\ncan be used to generate summaries and outlines of texts, which\ncan help students to quickly understand the main points of a\ntext and to organize their thoughts for writing. Additionally,\nlarge language models can also assist in the development of\nresearch skills by providing students with information and re-\nsources on a particular topic and hinting at unexplored aspects\nand current research topics, which can help them to better\nunderstand and analyze the material.\nFor group & remote learning, large language models\ncan be used to facilitate group discussions and debates by\nproviding a discussion structure, real-time feedback and per-\nsonalized guidance to students during the discussion. This\ncan help to improve student engagement and participation. In\ncollaborative writing activities, where multiple students work\ntogether to write a document or a project, language models\ncan assist by providing style and editing suggestions as well\nas other integrative co-writing features. For research purposes,\nsuch models can be used to span the range of open research\nquestions in relation to already researched topics and to au-\ntomatically assign the questions and topics to the involved\nteam members. For remote tutoring purposes, they can be\nused to automatically generate questions and provide practice\nproblems, explanations, and assessments that are tailored to\nthe students\u2019 level of knowledge so that they can learn at their\nown pace.\nTo empower learners with disabilities, large language\nmodels can be used in combination with speech-to-text or text-\nto-speech solutions to help people with visual impairment. In\ncombination with the previously mentioned group and remote\ntutoring opportunities, language models can be used to de-\nvelop inclusive learning strategies with adequate support in\ntasks such as adaptive writing, translating, and highlighting\nof important content in various formats. However, it is im-\nportant to note that the use of large language models should\nbe accompanied by the help of professionals such as speech\ntherapists, educators, and other specialists that can adapt the\ntechnology to the specific needs of the learner\u2019s disabilities.\nFor professional training, large language models can\nassist in the development of language skills that are specific\nto a particular field of work. They can also assist in the\ndevelopment of skills such as programming, report writing,\nproject management, decision making and problem-solving.\nFor example, large language models can be fine-tuned on\na domain-specific corpus (e.g. legal, medical, IT) in order\nto generate domain-specific language and assist learners in\nwriting technical reports, legal documents, medical records etc."

On Opportunities and Challenges of Large Language Models for Education \u2014 3/13\nThey can also generate questions and prompts that encourage\nlearners to think critically about their work and to analyze and\ninterpret the information presented to them.\nIn conclusion, large language models have the potential to\nprovide a wide range of benefits and opportunities for students\nand professionals at all stages of education. They can assist\nin the development of reading, writing, math, science, and\nlanguage skills, as well as providing students with personal-\nized practice materials, summaries and explanations, which\ncan help to improve student performance and contribute to en-\nhanced learning experiences. Additionally, large language\nmodels can also assist in research, writing, and problem-\nsolving tasks, and provide domain-specific language skills\nand other skills for professional training. However, as pre-\nviously mentioned, the use of these models should be done\nwith caution, as they also have limitations such as lack of\ninterpretability and potential for bias, unexpected brittleness\nin relatively simple tasks [9] which need to be addressed.\n1.2 Opportunities for Teaching\nLarge language models, such as ChatGPT, have the potential\nto revolutionize teaching and assist in teaching processes.\nBelow we provide only a few examples of how these models\ncan benefit teachers:\nFor personalized learning, teachers can use large lan-\nguage models to create personalized learning experiences for\ntheir students. These models can analyze student\u2019s writing\nand responses, and provide tailored feedback and suggest ma-\nterials that align with the student\u2019s specific learning needs.\nSuch support can save teachers\u2019 time and effort in creating\npersonalized materials and feedback, and also allow them to\nfocus on other aspects of teaching, such as creating engaging\nand interactive lessons.\nFor lesson planning, large language models can also as-\nsist teachers in the creation of (inclusive) lesson plans and\nactivities. Teachers can input to the models the corpus of\ndocument based on which they want to build a course. The\noutput can be a course syllabus with short description of each\ntopic. Language models can also generate questions and\nprompts that encourage the participation of people at different\nknowledge and ability levels, and elicit critical thinking and\nproblem-solving. Moreover, they can be used to generate tar-\ngeted and personalized practice problems and quizzes, which\ncan help to ensure that students are mastering the material.\nFor language learning, teachers of language classes can\nuse large language models in an assistive way, e.g., to high-\nlight important phrases, generate summaries and translations,\nprovide explanations of grammar and vocabulary, suggest\ngrammatical or style improvements and assist in conversation\npractice. Language models can also provide teachers with\nadaptive and personalized means to assist students in their\nlanguage learning journey, which can make language learning\nmore engaging and effective for students.\nFor research and writing, large language models can\nassist teachers of university and high school classes to com-\nplete research and writing tasks (e.g., in seminar works, paper\nwriting, and feedback to students) more efficiently and effec-\ntively. The most basic help can happen at a syntactic level,\ni.e., identifying and correcting typos. At a semantic level,\nlarge language models can be used to highlight (potential)\ngrammatical inconsistencies and suggest adequate and person-\nalized improvement strategies. Going further, these models\ncan be used to identify possibilities for topic-specific style\nimprovement. They can also be used to generate summaries\nand outlines of challenging texts, which can help teachers and\nresearchers to highlight the main points of a text in a way\nthat is helpful for further deep dive and understanding of the\ncontent in question.\nFor professional development, large language models\ncan also assist teachers by providing them with resources,\nsummaries, and explanations of new teaching methodologies,\ntechnologies, and materials. This can help teachers stay up-to-\ndate with the latest developments and techniques in education,\nand contribute to the effectiveness of their teaching. They can\nbe used to improve the clarity of the teaching materials, locate\ninformation or resources that professionals may be in need for\nas they learn on the job, as well as used for on-the-job training\nmodules that require presentation and communication skills.\nFor assessment and evaluation, teachers can use large\nlanguage models to semi-automate the grading of student work\nby highlighting potential strengths and weakness of the work\nin question, e.g., essays, research papers, and other writing\nassignments. This can save teachers a significant amount of\ntime for tasks related to individualized feedback to students.\nFurthermore, large language models can also be used to check\nfor plagiarism, which can help to prevent cheating. Hence,\nlarge language models can help teachers to identify areas\nwhere students are struggling, which adds to a more accurate\nassessments of student learning development and challenges.\nTargeted instruction provided by the models can be used to\nhelp students excel and to provide opportunities for further\ndevelopment.\nThe acquaintance of students with AI challenges related\nto the potential bias in the output, the need for continuous hu-\nman oversight, and the potential for misuse of large language\nmodels are not unique to education. In fact, these challenges\nare inherent to transformative digital technologies. Thus, we\nbelieve that, if handled sensibly by the teacher, these chal-\nlenges can be insightful in learning and education scenarios to\nacquaint students early on with potential societal biases, and\nrisks of AI application.\nIn conclusion, large language models have the potential\nto revolutionize teaching from a teacher\u2019s perspective by pro-\nviding teachers with a wide range of tools and resources that\ncan assist with lesson planning, personalized content creation,\ndifferentiation and personalized instruction, assessment, and\nprofessional development. Overall, large language models\nhave the potential to be a powerful tool in education, and\nthere are a number of ongoing research efforts exploring its\npotential applications in this area."

    "text": "ChatGPT for Good? On Opportunities and Challenges of Large Language Models for Education \u2014 4/13\n2. Current Research and Applications of\nLanguage Models in Education\n2.1 Overview of Current Large Language Models\nThe GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) [10] model\ndeveloped by OpenAI was the first large language model that\nwas publicly released in 2018. GPT was able to generate\nhuman-like text, answer questions, and assist in tasks, such as\ntranslation and summarization, through human-like comple-\ntion. Based on this initial model, OpenAI later released the\nGPT-2 and GPT-3 models with more advanced capabilities.\nIt can be argued that the release of GPT marked a significant\nmilestone in the field of NLP and has opened up many ways\nfor dissemination, both in research and industrial applications.\nAnother model that was released by Google Research in\n2018 is BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers [2]), which is also based on a transformer ar-\nchitecture and is pre-trained on a massive dataset of text data\non two unsupervised tasks, namely masked language mod-\neling (to predict missing parts in a sentence and learn their\ncontext) and next sentence prediction (to learn plausible sub-\nsequent sentences of a given sentence) with the aim to learn\nthe broader context of words in various topics.\nOne year later in 2019, Google AI released XLNet [11],\nwhich is trained using a process called permutation language\nmodeling and enables XLNet to cope with tasks that involve\nunderstanding the dependencies between words in a sentence,\ne.g., natural language inference and question answering. An-\nother model developed by Google Research was T5 (Text-to-\nText Transfer Transformer) [12], which was released in 2020.\nLike the predecessor models, T5 is also transformer-based\nmodel trained on a massive text dataset with the key feature\nbeing its ability to perform many NLP tasks with a single\npre-training and fine-tuning pipeline.\nIn parallel with Open AI and Google, Facebook AI devel-\noped a large language model called RoBERTa (Robustly Opti-\nmized BERT Pre-training) [13], which was released in 2019.\nRoBERTa is a variant of the BERT model which uses dynamic\nmasking instead of static masking during pre-training. Addi-\ntionally, RoBERTa is trained on a much larger dataset, and\nhence clearly outperformed BERT and other models such as\nGPT-2 and XLNet by the time of its release.\nCurrently, the most widely used and the largest available\nlanguage model is GPT-3, which was also pre-trained on a\nmassive text dataset (including books, articles, and websites,\namong other sources) and has 175 billion parameters. As all\nother previously described language models, GPT-3 uses a\ntransformer architecture, which allows it to efficiently process\nsequential data and generate more coherent and contextually\nadjusted text. Indeed, text generated by GPT-3 is almost\nindistinguishable from human-written text [14]. With the\nability to perform zero-shot learning, GPT-3 can cope with\ntasks it has not been specifically trained on, providing hence\nenormous opportunities for applications, from automation\n(summarizing, completing texts from bullet points), to dialog\nsystems, chatbots, and creative writing.\nJust recently, the BigScience-community developed and\nreleased the large language model BLOOM (BigScience Large\nOpen-science Open-access Multilingual Language Model) [15]\nas on open-source joint project by HuggingFace, GENCI and\nIDRIS3. The aim of this project was to provide a transparently\ntrained multi-lingual language model for the academic and\nnon-profit community. BLOOM is based on the same trans-\nformer architecture as the models from the GPT-family with\nonly minor structural changes, but the training data was explic-\nitly chosen to cover 46 natural languages and 13 programming\nlanguages, resulting in a data volume of 1.6TB.\n2.2 Review of Research Applying Large Language\nModels in Education\nIn the following, we provide an overview of research works\nemploying large language models in education that were pub-\nlished since the release of the first large language model in\n2018. These studies have been discussed in the following\naccording to their target groups, i.e., learners or teachers.\nLearners\u2019 perspective.\nFrom a student\u2019s perspective, large\nlanguage models can be used in multiple ways to assist the\nlearning process. One example is in the creation and design of\neducational content. For example, researchers have used large\nlanguage models to generate interactive educational materials\nsuch as quizzes and flashcards, which can be used to improve\nstudent learning and engagement [16, 17]. More specifically,\nin a recent work by Dijkstra et al. [17], researchers have used\nGPT-3 to generate multiple-choice questions and answers\nfor a reading comprehension task and argue that automated\ngeneration of quizzes not only reduces the burden of manual\nquiz design for teachers but, above all, provides a helpful tool\nfor students to train and test their knowledge while learning\nfrom textbooks and during exam preparation [17].\nIn another recent work, GPT-3 was employed as a ped-\nagogical agent to stimulate the curiosity of children and en-\nhance question-asking skills [18]. More specifically, the au-\nthors automated the generation of curiosity-prompting cues\nas an incentive for asking more and deeper questions. Ac-\ncording to their results, large language models not only bear\nthe potential to significantly facilitate the implementation of\ncuriosity-stimulating learning but can also serve as an efficient\ntool towards an increased curiosity expression [18].\nIn computing education, a recent work by MacNeil et\nal. [19] has employed GPT-3 to generate code explanations.\nDespite several open research and pedagogical questions that\nneed to be further explored, this work has successfully demon-\nstrated the potential of GPT-3 to support learning by explain-\ning aspects of a given code snippet.\nFor a data science course, Bhat et al. [20] proposed a\npipeline for generating assessment questions based on a fine-\ntuned GPT3 model on text-based learning materials. The gen-\nerated questions were further evaluated with regard to their\nusefulness to the learning outcome based on automated label-\n3https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom"

The authors reported that the generated questions\nwere rated favorably by human experts, promoting thus the\nusage of large language models in data science education [20].\nStudents can learn from each other by peer-reviewing and\nassessing each other\u2019s solutions. This, of course, has the best\neffect when the given feedback is comprehensive and of high\nquality. For example, Jia et al. [21] showed how BERT can\nbe used to evaluate the peer assessments so that students can\nlearn to improve their feedback.\nIn a recent review on conversational AI in language edu-\ncation, the authors found that there are five main applications\nof conversational AI during teaching [22], the most common\none being the use of large language models as a conversa-\ntional partner in a written or oral form, e.g., in the context\nof a task-oriented dialogue that provides language practice\nopportunities such as pronunciation [23]. Another application\nis to support students when they experience foreign language\nlearning anxiety [24] or have a lower willingness to commu-\nnicate [25]. In [26], the application of providing feedback, as\na needs analyst, and evaluator when primary school students\npractice their vocabulary was explored. The authors of [27]\nfound that a chatbot that is guided by a mind map is more suc-\ncessful in supporting students by providing scaffolds during\nlanguage learning than a conventional AI chatbot.\nA recent work in the area of medical education by Kung et\nal. [28] explored the performance of ChatGPT on the United\nStates Medical Licensing Exam. According to the evaluation\nresults, the performance of ChatGPT on this test was at or\nnear the passing threshold without any domain fine-tuning.\nBased on these results, the authors argue that large language\nmodels might be a powerful tool to assist medical education\nand eventually clinical decision-making processes [28].\nTeachers\u2019 perspective.\nAs the rate of adoption of AI in\neducation is still slow compared to other fields, such as indus-\ntrial applications (e.g., finance, e-commerce, automotive) or\nmedicine, there are less studies considering the use of large\nlanguage models in education [29]. A recent review of oppor-\ntunities and challenges of chatbots in education pointed out\nthat the studies related to chatbots in education are still in an\nearly stage, with few empirical studies investigating the use of\neffective learning designs or learning strategies [30]. There-\nfore, we discuss first the teachers\u2019 perspectives concerning AI\nand Learning Analytics in education and transfer these on the\nmuch newer field of large language models.\nIn this view, a pilot study with European teachers indi-\ncates a positive attitude towards AI for education and a high\nmotivation to introduce AI-related content at school. Overall,\nthe teachers from the study seemed to have a basic level of\ndigital skills but low AI-related skills [31]. Another study\nwith Nigerian teachers emphasized that the willingness and\nreadiness of teachers to promote AI are key prerequisites for\nthe integration of AI-based technologies in education [32].\nAlong the same lines, the results of a study with teachers from\nSouth Korea indicate that teachers with constructivist beliefs\nare more likely to integrate educational AI-based tools than\nteachers with transmissive orientations [33]. Furthermore, per-\nceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived trust in\nthese AI-based tools are determinants to be considered when\npredicting their acceptance by the teachers. Similar results\nconcerning teachers attitudes towards chatbots in education\nwere reported in [34]: perceiving the AI chatbot as easy-to-\nuse and useful leads to greater acceptance of the chatbot. As\nfor the chatbots\u2019 features, formal language by a chatbot leads\nto a higher intention of using it.\nAs it seems that teachers\u2019 perspectives on the general use\nof AI in education have a lot in common with the mentioned at-\ntitude towards chatbots in particular, a responsible integration\nof AI into education by involving the expertise of different\ncommunities is crucial [35].\nRecent works addressing the use of large language models\nfrom the teacher\u2019s perspective have focused on the automated\nassessment of student answers, adaptive feedback, and the\ngeneration of teaching content.\nFor example, a recent work by Moore et al. [36] employed\na fine-tuned GPT-3 model to evaluate student-generated an-\nswers in a learning environment for chemistry education [36].\nThe authors argue that large language models might (espe-\ncially when fine-tuned to the specific domain) be a powerful\ntool to assist teachers in the quality and pedagogical evalua-\ntion of student answers [36]. In addition, the following studies\nexamined NLP-based models for generating automatic adap-\ntive feedback: Zhu et al. [37] examined an AI-based feedback\nsystem incorporating automated scoring technologies in the\ncontext of a high school climate activity task. The results show\nthat the feedback helped students revise their scientific argu-\nments. Sailer et al. [38] used NLP-based adaptive feedback\nin the context of diagnosing students\u2019 learning difficulties in\nteacher education. In their experimental study, they found that\npre-service teachers who received adaptive feedback were\nbetter able to justify their diagnoses than prospective teachers\nwho received static feedback. Bernius et al. [39] used NLP-\nbased models to generate feedback for textual student answers\nin large courses, where grading effort could be reduced by\nup to 85% with a high precision and an improved quality\nperceived by the students.\nLarge language models can not only support the assess-\nment of student\u2019s solutions but also assist in the automatic\ngeneration of exercises. Using few-shot learning, [40] showed\nthat the OpenAI Codex model is able to provide a variety of\nprogramming tasks together with the correct solution, auto-\nmated tests to verify the student\u2019s solutions, and additional\ncode explanations. With regard to testing factual knowledge\nin general, [41] proposed a framework to automatically gen-\nerate question-answer pairs. This can be used in the creation\nof teaching materials, e.g., for reading comprehension tasks.\nBeyond the generation of the correct answer, transformer\nmodels are also able to create distractor answers, as needed\nfor the generation of multiple choice questionnaires [42, 43].\nBringing language models to mathematics education, sev-"

Both models used in\nthis work (Blender and GPT-3) were capable of replying to\na student adequately and generated conversational dialogues\nthat conveyed the impression that these models understand the\nlearner (in particular Blender). They are however well behind\nhuman performance when it comes to helping the student [47],\nthus emphasizing the need for further research.\n3. Opportunities for Innovative\nEducational Technologies\nLooking forward, large language models bear the potential to\nconsiderably improve digital ecosystems for education, such\nas environments based on Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual\nReality (VR) [48, 49], and other related digital experiences.\nSpecifically, they can be used to amplify several key fac-\ntors, which are crucial for the immersive interaction of users\nwith digital content. For example, large language models\ncan considerably improve the natural language processing\nand understanding capabilities of an AR/VR system to enable\nan effective natural communication and interaction between\nusers and the system (e.g., virtual teacher or virtual peers).\nThe latter has been identified early on as a key usability aspect\nfor immersive educational technologies [50] and is in general\nseen as a key factor for improving the interaction between\nhumans and AI systems [51].\nLarge language models can also be used to develop more\nnatural and sophisticated user interfaces by exploiting their\nability to generate contextualized, personalized, and diverse\nresponses to natural language questions asked by users. Fur-\nthermore, their ability to answer natural language questions\nacross various domains can facilitate the integration of diverse\ndigital applications into a unified framework or application,\nwhich is also critical for expanding the bounds of educational\npossibilities and experiences [52, 49].\nIn general, the ability of these models to generate contextu-\nalized natural language texts, code for various implementation\ntasks [53] as well as various types of multimedia content\n(e.g., in combination with other AI systems, such as DALL-\nE [54]) can enable and scale the creation of compelling and\nimmersive digital (e.g., AR/VR) experiences. From gamifica-\ntion to detailed simulations for immersive learning in digital\nenvironments, large language models are a key enabling tech-\nnology. To fully realize this potential, however, it is important\nto consider not only technical aspects but also ethical, legal,\necological and social implications.\nIn the following section, we take a brief look at the risks re-\nlated to the application on large language models in education\nand provide corresponding mitigation strategies.\n4. Key Challenges and Risks Related to\nthe Application of Large Language\nModels in Education\nCopyright Issues.\nWhen we train large language models on\na task to produce education-related content \u2013 course syllabus,\nquizzes, scientific paper \u2013 the mode should be trained on\nexamples of such texts. During the generation for a new\nprompt, the answer may contain a full sentence or even a\nparagraph seen in the training set, leading to copyright and\nplagiarism issues.\nImportant steps to responsibly mitigate such an issue can\nbe the following:\n\u2022 Asking the authors of the original documents trans-\nparently (i.e., purpose and policy of data usage) for\npermission to use their content for training the model\n\u2022 Compliance with copyright terms for open-source con-\ntent\n\u2022 Inheritance and detailed terms of use for the content\ngenerated by the model\n\u2022 Informing and raising awareness of the users about\nthese policies\nBias and fairness.\nLarge language models can perpetuate\nand amplify existing biases and unfairness in society, which\ncan negatively impact teaching and learning processes and\noutcomes. For example, if a model is trained on data that\nis biased towards certain groups of people, it may produce\nresults that are unfair or discriminatory towards those groups\n(e.g., local knowledge about minorities such as small ethnic\ngroups or cultures can fade into the background). Thus, it is\nimportant to ensure that the training data or the data used for\nfine-tuning on down-stream tasks for the model is diverse and\nrepresentative of different groups of people. Regular monitor-\ning and testing of the model\u2019s performance on different groups\nof people can help identify and address any biases early on.\nHence, human oversight in the process is indispensable and\ncritical for the mitigation of bias and beneficial application of\nlarge language models in education.\nMore specifically, a responsible mitigation strategy would\nfocus on the following key aspects:\n\u2022 A diverse set of data to train or fine-tune the model, to\nensure that it is not biased towards any particular group\n\u2022 Regular monitoring and evaluation of the model\u2019s per-\nformance (on diverse groups of people) to identify and\naddress any biases that may arise\n\u2022 Fairness measures and bias-correction techniques, such\nas pre-processing or post-processing methods\n\u2022 Transparency mechanisms that enable users to compre-\nhend the model\u2019s output, and the data and assumptions\nthat were used to generate it"

Thus a responsible mitigation strategy would focus\non the following key aspects:\n\u2022 Raising awareness of the limitations and unexpected\nbrittleness of large language models and AI systems in\ngeneral (i.e., experimenting with the model to build an\nown understanding of the workings and limitations)\n\u2022 Using language models to generate hypotheses and ex-\nplore different perspectives, rather than just to generate\nanswers\n\u2022 Strategies to use other educational resources (e.g., books,\narticles) and other authoritative sources to evaluate and\ncorroborate the factual correctness of the information\nprovided by the model (i.e., encouraging learners to\nquestion the generated content)\n\u2022 Incorporating critical thinking and problem-solving ac-\ntivities into the curriculum, to help students develop\nthese skills\n\u2022 Incorporating human expertise and teachers to review,\nvalidate and explain the information provided by the\nmodel\nIt is important to note that the use of large language models\nshould be integrated into the curriculum in a way that com-\nplements and enhances the learning experience, rather than\nreplacing it.\nTeachers may become too reliant on the models.\nUsing\nlarge language models can provide accurate and relevant infor-\nmation, but they cannot replace the creativity, critical thinking,\nand problem-solving skills that are developed through human\ninstruction. It is therefore important for teachers to use these\nmodels as a supplement to their instruction, rather than a\nreplacement. Thus, crucial aspects to mitigate the risk of\nbecoming too reliant on large language models are:\n\u2022 The use of language models only as as a complementary\nsupplement to the generation of instructions\n\u2022 Ongoing training and professional development for\nteachers, enabling them to stay up-to-date on the best-\npractise use of language models in the classroom to\nelicit and promote creativity and critical thinking\n\u2022 Critical thinking and problem-solving activities through\nthe assistance of digital technologies as an integral part\nof the curriculum to ensure that students are developing\nthese skills\n\u2022 Engagement of students in creative and independent\nprojects that allow them to develop their own ideas and\nsolutions\n\u2022 Monitoring and evaluating the use of language models\nin the classroom to ensure that they are being used ef-\nfectively and not negatively impacting student learning\n\u2022 Incentives for teachers and schools to develop (inclu-\nsive, collaborative, and personalized) teaching strate-\ngies based on large language models and engage stu-\ndents in problem-solving processes such as retrieving\nand evaluating course/assignment-relevant information\nusing the models and other sources\nLack of understanding and expertise.\nMany educators and\neducational institutions may not have the knowledge or exper-\ntise to effectively integrate new technologies in their teaching\n[56]. This particularly applies to the use and integration of\nlarge language models into teaching practice. Educational\ntheory has long since suggested ways of integrating novel\ntools into educational practice (e.g., [57]). As with any other\ntechnological innovation, integrating large language models\ninto effective teaching practice requires understanding their\ncapabilities and limitations, as well as how to effectively use\nthem to supplement or enhance specific learning processes.\nThere are several ways to address these challenges and\nencounter this risk:\n\u2022 Research on the challenges of large language models in\neducation by investigating existing educational models\nof technology integration, students\u2019 learning processes\nand transfer them to the context of large language mod-\nels, as well as developing a new educational theory\nspecifically for the context of large language models\n\u2022 Assessing the needs of the educators and students and\nprovide case-based guidance (e.g., for the secure ethical\nuse of large language models in education scenarios)\n\u2022 Demand-oriented Training and professional develop-\nment opportunities for educators and institutions to\nlearn about the capabilities and potential uses of large\nlanguage models in education, as well as providing\nbest practices for integrating them into their teaching\nmethods"

As a result, the New York City\u2019s\nDepartment of Education recently banned ChatGPT from\nschools\u2019 devices and networks [62].\nJust recently, Cotton et al. [60] proposed several strate-\ngies to detect work that has been generated by large language\nmodels, and specifically ChatGPT. In addition, tools, such as\nthe recently released GPTZero [63], which uses perplexity,\nas a measure that hints at generalization capabilities (of the\nagent by which the text was written), to detect AI involvement\nin text writing, are expected to provide additional support.\nMore advanced techniques aim at watermarking the content\ngenerated by language models [64, 65], e.g., by biasing the\ncontent generation towards terms, which are rather unlikely\nto be jointly used by humans in a text passage. In the long\nrun, however, we believe that developing curricula and instruc-\ntions that encourage the creative and evidence-based use of\nlarge language models will be the key to solving this problem.\nHence, a reasonable mitigation strategy for this risk should\nfocus on:\n\u2022 Research on transparency, explanation and analysis\ntechniques and measures to distinguish machine- from\nhuman-generated text\n\u2022 Incentives and support to develop curricula and instruc-\ntions that require the creative and complementary use\nof large language models\nCost of training and maintenance.\nThe maintenance of\nlarge language models could be a financial burden for schools\nand educational institutions, especially those with limited\nbudgets. To address this challenge, the use of pre-trained mod-\nels and cloud technology in combination with cooperative\nschemes for usage in partnership with institutions and com-\npanies can serve as a starting point. Specifically, a mitigation\nstrategy for this risk should focus on the following aspects:\n\u2022 Use of pre-trained open-source models, which can be\nfine-tuned for specific tasks\n\u2022 Development and exploration of partnerships with pri-\nvate companies, research institutions as well as govern-\nmental and non-profit organizations that can provide\nfinancial support, resources and expertise to support the\nuse of large language models in education\n\u2022 Shared costs and cooperative use of scalable (e.g., cloud)\ncomputing services that provide access to powerful\ncomputational resources at a low cost\n\u2022 Use of the model primarily for high-value educational\ntasks, such as providing personalized and targeted learn-\ning experiences for students (i.e., assignment of lower\npriority to low-value tasks)\n\u2022 Research and development of compression, distillation,\nand pruning techniques to reduce the size of the model,\nthe data, and the computational resources required\nData privacy and security.\nThe use of large language mod-\nels in education raises concerns about data privacy and secu-\nrity, as student data is often sensitive and personal. This can\ninclude concerns about data breaches, unauthorized access to\nstudent data, and the use of student data for purposes other\nthan education.\nSome specific focus areas to mitigate privacy and security\nconcerns when using large language models in education are:\n\u2022 Development and implementation of robust data privacy\nand security policies that clearly outline the collection,\nstorage, and use of student data in compliance with\nregulation (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, FERPA) and ethical\nstandards\n\u2022 Transparency towards students and their families about\nthe data collection, storage, and use practices, with\nobligatory consent before data collection and use\n\u2022 Modern technologies and measures to protect the col-\nlected data from unauthorized access, breaches, or un-\nethical use (e.g., anonymized data and secure infras-\ntructures with modern means for encryption, federation,\nprivacy-preserving analytics, etc.)\n\u2022 Regular audits of the data privacy and security measures\nin place to identify and address any potential vulnera-\nbilities or areas for improvement\n\u2022 Incident response plan to quickly respond and mitigate\nany data breaches or unauthorized access to data\n\u2022 Education and awareness of the staff, i.e., educators\nand students about the data privacy and security poli-\ncies, regulations, ethical concerns and best practices to\nhandle and report related risks"

Hence, energy-efficient hardware and shared (e.g., cloud)\ninfrastructure based on renewable energy are crucial for their\nenvironmentally sustainable operation and scaling needed in\nthe context of education.\nFor model training and updates, only data that has been\ncollected and annotated in a regulatory compliant and ethical\nway should be considered. Therefore, governance frameworks\nthat include policies, procedures, and controls to ensure such\nappropriate use of such models are key to their successful\nadoption.\nLikewise, for the long-term trustworthy and responsible\nuse of the models, transparency, bias mitigation, and ongoing\nmonitoring are indispensable.\nIn summary, the mitigation strategy for this risk would\ninclude:\n\u2022 Energy-efficient hardware and shared infrastructure\nbased on renewable energy as well as research on reduc-\ning the cost of training and maintenance (i.e., efficient\nalgorithms, representation, and storage)\n\u2022 Collection, annotation, storage, and processing of data\nin a regulatory compliant and ethical way\n\u2022 Transparency and explanation techniques to identify\nand mitigate biases and prevent unfairness\n\u2022 Governance frameworks that include policies, proce-\ndures, and controls to ensure the above points and the\nappropriate use in education\nCost to verify information and maintain integrity.\nIt is\nimportant to verify the information provided by the model by\nconsulting external authoritative sources to ensure accuracy\nand integrity. Additionally, there may be financial costs asso-\nciated with maintaining and updating the model to ensure it is\nproviding accurate up-to-date information.\nA responsible mitigation strategy for this risk would con-\nsider the following key aspects:\n\u2022 Regularly updates of the model with new and accurate\ninformation to ensure it is providing up-to-date and\naccurate information\n\u2022 Use of multiple authoritative sources to verify the in-\nformation provided by the model to ensure correctness\nand integrity\n\u2022 Use of the model in conjunction with human expertise,\ne.g., teachers or subject matter experts, who review and\nvalidate the information provided by the model\n\u2022 Development of protocol and standards for fact-checking\nand corroborating information provided by the model\n\u2022 Provide clear and transparent information on the model\u2019s\nperformance, what it is or is not capable of, and the con-\nditions under which it operates.\n\u2022 Training and resources for educators and learners on\nhow to use the model, interpret its results and evaluate\nthe information provided\n\u2022 Regular review and evaluation of the model with trans-\nparent reporting on the model\u2019s performance, i.e., what\nit is or is not capable of and the identification of con-\nditions under which inaccuracies or other issues may\narise\nDifficulty to distinguish between real knowledge and con-\nvincingly written but unverified model output.\nThe abil-\nity of large language models to generate human-like text can\nmake it difficult for students to distinguish between real knowl-\nedge and unverified information. This can lead to students\naccepting false or misleading information as true, without\nquestioning its validity.\nTo mitigate this risk, in addition to the above verification-\nand integrity-related mitigation strategy, it is important to pro-\nvide education on how information can be evaluated critically\nand teach students exploration, investigation, verification, and\ncorroboration strategies.\nLack of adaptability.\nLarge language models are not able to\nadapt to the diverse needs of students and teachers, and may\nnot be able to provide the level of personalization required for\neffective learning.

Further Issues Related to User\nInterfaces and Fair Access\nAppropriate user interfaces.\nFor the integration of large\nlanguage models into educational workflows, further research\non Human-Computer Interaction and User Interface Design is\nnecessary.\nIn this work, we have discussed several potential use cases\nfor learners of different age \u2013 from children to adults. While\ncreating such AI-based assistants, we should take into account\nthe degree of psychological maturity, fine motor skills, and\ntechnical abilities of the potential users. Thus, the user in-\nterface should be appropriate for the task, but may also have\nvarying degrees of human imitation \u2013 for instance, for chil-\ndren it might be better to hide machinery artifacts in generated\ntext and use gamified interaction and learning approaches\nas much as possible so as to enable a smooth and engaging\ninteraction with such technologies, whereas for older learn-\ners the machine-based content could be exploited to promote\nproblem-solving, critical thinking and fact-checking abilities.\nIn general, the design of user interfaces for AI-based as-\nsistance and learning tools should promote the development\nof 21st century learning and problem-solving skills [66], espe-\ncially, critical thinking, creativity, communication, and collab-\noration, for which further evidence-based research is needed.\nIn this context, a crucial aspect is the appropriate age- and\nbackground-related integration of AI-based assistance to max-\nimize its benefits and minimize any potential drawbacks.\nMultilingualism and fair access.\nWhile the majority of\nthe research in large language models is done for the En-\nglish language, there is still a gap of research in this field\nfor other languages. This can potentially make education for\nEnglish-speaking users easier and more efficient than for other\nusers, causing unfair access to such education technologies\nfor non-English speaking users. Despite the efforts of various\nresearch communities to address multilingualism fairness for\nAI technologies, there is still much room for improvement.\nLastly, the unfairness related to financial means for access-\ning, training and maintaining large language models may need\nto be regulated by governmental organisations with the aim\nto provide equity-oriented means to all educational entities\ninterested in using these modern technologies. Without fair\naccess, this AI technology may seriously widen the education\ngap like no other technology before it.\nWe therefore conclude with UNESCO\u2019s call to ensure that\nAI does not widen the technological and educational divides\nwithin and between countries, and recommended important\nstrategies for the use of AI in a responsible and fair way to\nreduce this existing gap instead. According to the UNESCO\neducation 2030 Agenda [67]: \u201cUNESCO\u2019s mandate calls in-\nherently for a human-centred approach to AI. It aims to shift\nthe conversation to include AI\u2019s role in addressing current\ninequalities regarding access to knowledge, research and the\ndiversity of cultural expressions and to ensure AI does not\nwiden the technological divides within and between countries.\nThe promise of \u201cAI for all\u201d must be that everyone can take ad-\nvantage of the technological revolution under way and access\nits fruits, notably in terms of innovation and knowledge.\u201d\n6. Concluding Remarks\nThe use of large language models in education is a promising\narea of research that offers many opportunities to enhance the\nlearning experience for students and support the work of teach-\ners. However, to unleash their full potential for education, it is\ncrucial to approach the use of these models with caution and\nto critically evaluate their limitations and potential biases. In-\ntegrating large language models into education must therefore\nmeet stringent privacy, security, and - for sustainable scal-\ning - environmental, regulatory and ethical requirements, and\nmust be done in conjunction with ongoing human monitoring,\nguidance, and critical thinking.\nWhile this position paper reflects the optimism of the au-\nthors about the opportunities of large language models as a\ntransformative technology in education, it also underscores\nthe need for further research to explore best practices for inte-\ngrating large language models into education and to mitigate\nthe risks identified.\nWe believe that despite many difficulties and challenges,\nthe discussed risks are manageable and should be addressed to\nprovide trustworthy and fair access to large language models\nfor education. Towards this goal, the mitigation strategies\nproposed in this position paper could serve as a starting point.\nReferences\n[1] Luciano Floridi and Massimo Chiriatti.
