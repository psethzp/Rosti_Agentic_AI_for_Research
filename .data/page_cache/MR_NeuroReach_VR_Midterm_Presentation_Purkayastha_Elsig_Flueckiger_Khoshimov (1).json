    "text": "Blockers & Solutions\n\u2022\nChallenge 1: Development is slowed by limited Windows access and Unity VCS user limits\n\u2212Solution: We are migrating to GitHub with Git LFS to remove collaborator limits and have also requested a new machine from the \nsupervisors. Currently we have divided the work into independent tasks integrated at regular intervals to minimize dependency on \nhardware.\n\u2022\nChallenge 2: Integrating haptic feedback is complex as the necessary API functions are extensively distributed across multiple \ndocumentation sources.\n\u2212Solution: We are exploring the systematic mapping of API functions to specific haptic outputs through targeted technical \nexperiment runs. We also plan to maintain a parallel build not fully dependent on haptics as a fallback to ensure the project \nexecution is not delayed.\n\u2022\nChallenge 3: The user interface must be highly accessible for individuals with motor and cognitive impairments\n\u2212Solution: We are prototyping with frequent testing to refine the user experience. This focuses on an intuitive menu along with \nclear controls and feedback, using high-contrast assets and consulting standard accessibility guidelines for maximum clarity.\nNeuroReach VR\n03.11.2025\n4"
