The SPUTNIC study (Study Panel on Upcoming \nTechnologies to study Non-Ionizing radiation and Cognition) aimed to investigate possible correlations between \nmobile phone radiation and human health, including cognition, health-related quality of life and sleep. \nMethods: Adult participants tracked various daily markers of RF-EMF exposures (cordless calls, mobile calls, and \nmobile screen time 4 h prior to each assessment) as well as three health outcomes over ten study days: 1) \ncognitive performance, 2) health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and 3) sleep duration and quality. Cognitive \nperformance was measured through six \u201cgame-like\u201d tests, assessing verbal and visuo-spatial performance \nrepeatedly. HRQoL was assessed as fatigue, mood and stress on a Likert-scale (1\u201310). Sleep duration and effi\u00ad\nciency was measured using activity trackers. We fitted mixed models with random intercepts per participant on \ncognitive, HRQoL and sleep scores. Possible time-varying confounders were assessed at daily intervals by \nquestionnaire and used for model adjustment. \nResults: A total of 121 participants ultimately took part in the SPUTNIC study, including 63 from Besancon and 58 \nfrom Basel. Self-reported wireless phone use and screen time were sporadically associated with visuo-spatial and \nverbal cognitive performance, compatible with chance findings. We found a small but robust significant increase \nin stress 0.03 (0.00\u20130.06; on a 1\u201310 Likert-scale) in relation to a 10-min increase in mobile phone screen time. \nSleep duration and quality were not associated with either cordless or mobile phone calls, or with screen time. \nDiscussion: The study did not find associations between short-term RF-EMF markers and cognitive performance, \nHRQoL, or sleep duration and quality. The most consistent finding was increased stress in relation to more screen \ntime, but no association with cordless or mobile phone call time.   \n1.

Because of this, the World Health Organization \n(WHO) has recently identified cognitive function, sleep and several \nhealth-related quality of life symptoms as priority topics for systematic \nreview (R\u00a8o\u00a8osli et al., 2021; Verbeek et al., 2021; Benke et al., 2022; \nBosch-Capblanch et al., 2022). \nCognitive function is typically considered as a mental process that \ninvolves a range of domains including learning, memory, reasoning, \nproblem solving, decision making and attention (Benke et al., 2022). \nSeveral previous research studies have observed effects on cognitive \nfunction in association with localized exposure of the head to radio \nfrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) (Curcio, 2018, Ishihara, \nYamazaki et al. 2020). The real-life short-term implications on cognitive \nperformance and health-related quality of life have not been well \nstudied. A recent study from Switzerland found indications that high \nEMF exposure is negatively associated with figural visuo-spatial skills, \nwhich are processed on the right side of the brain, but not verbal skills, \nlocated on the left side (Schoeni et al., 2015). This finding was replicated \nin an independent sample (Foerster et al., 2018), and is currently eval\u00ad\nuated in a cohort of adolescents from the UK (Toledano et al., 2019). \nSeveral studies have previously looked at RF-EMF exposure in rela\u00ad\ntion to non-specific physical symptoms like headaches, dizziness, con\u00ad\ncentration difficulties and anxiety. In randomized double-blind human \nexperimental studies, mostly no acute effect of RF-EMF exposure was \nobserved in general population samples or in individuals stating to react \nto EMF (Schmiedchen et al., 2019). In epidemiological studies and \npopulation surveys, extensive mobile phone and/or e-media use was \noften found to be related to reduced HRQoL including a wide range of \nsymptoms including behavioural problems, hearing loss, headaches, \nfatigue, concentration and stress (Chetty-Mhlanga, Fuhrimann et al. \n2020). Yet, studies targeted to separate biophysical effects from RF-EMF \nexposure from other non-physical related pathways such as addiction or \nnight-time use indicate that RF-EMF exposure is the least likely cause \n(Roser et al., 2016; Schoeni et al., 2016; Schoeni et al., 2017, Auvinen, \nFeychting et al. 2019, Guxens, Vermeulen et al. 2019) \nRegarding effects on sleep, several studies -rather consistently-point \nto changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha frequency range, \nboth awake (Danker-Hopfe et al., 2019; Wallace and Selmaoui, 2019) \nand while asleep (Regel et al., 2007) associated with RF-EMF exposure. \nIt is possible that such changes could affect working memory and \nmemory consolidation (Frenda and Fenn, 2016). Nevertheless, many \nstudies so far indicated no association between RF-EMF exposure and \nself-reported sleep quality (Tettamanti et al., 2020). \nThe SPUTNIC study (Study Panel on Upcoming Technologies to \nstudy Non-Ionizing radiation and Cognition) aimed to investigate the \nassociation between exposure to RF-EMF resulting from the use of mo\u00ad\nbile phones and cognitive performance (verbal as well as visuo-spatial \nskills), health-related quality of life and sleep quality, which are \npotentially associated with these exposures. We aim to see if we can \nreproduce the association between RF-EMF exposure and visuo-spatial \nskills (Schoeni et al., 2015, Foerster et al., 2018). We will further \ninvestigate whether we find a similar amplified association looking at \nright-handed individuals, as was found in previous studies (Schoeni \net al., 2015, Foerster et al., 2018), and whether the opposite is \u2013again- \ntrue for verbal skills. This paper describes the results of a panel study in \n121 adults on RF-EMF exposure markers and cognitive performance, as \nassessed through six innovative \u201cgame-like\u201d tasks, which each of the \nparticipants completed repeatedly. \n2. Methods \nThe SPUTNIC panel study gathered data from smartphone users in \nBasel (Switzerland) and Besancon (France), following each participant \nfor 10 days. We repeatedly obtained data on cognitive function and \nphone use (cordless and mobile call duration and screen time) from the \ngroup of volunteer participants between September 2019 and January \n2021. \n2.1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria \nWe included adults, between 18 and 70 years old, who used a \nsmartphone regularly, had access to a desktop, laptop, or tablet com\u00ad\nputer with internet access, spoke fluent German (Switzerland) or French \n(France), and lived within 30 min commuting time from one of the study \ncenters in Basel and Besancon. We strived for an equal representation of \nmales and females. We excluded participants with visual or hearing loss, \nthose with insufficient language skills or physical, mental or neurolog\u00ad\nical disorders which would make it impossible to complete the tests and \nquestionnaires (e.g. head trauma, stroke, neurodegenerative pathol\u00ad\nogies, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, dyslexia, attention deficit hyperac\u00ad\ntivity, major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder). We also \nexcluded people who were not able/willing to abstain from using psy\u00ad\nchoactive/recreational drugs for the duration of the study. We further \nexcluded people working night shifts and pregnant persons beyond the \n7th month, in order to minimize the risk of premature drop-out. Par\u00ad\nticipants were not asked whether they thought that any of the RF-EMF \nexposure markers affected any of the health endpoints studied. \n2.2. Recruitment of participants \nIn Switzerland, the study was advertised through printed flyers, \namong relatives, friends and family of the researchers, on the online \nplatform of Basel University, and as unpaid posts on Facebook, Insta\u00ad\ngram and Twitter, and in the popular free \u201c20 Minutes\u201d newspaper. In \nFrance, the study was advertised through printed posters, and commu\u00ad\nnications in regional and local newspapers, radio and TV. In total, 153 +\n145 people showed initial interest in the study (in Switzerland and \nFrance, respectively), and after determining eligibility, ultimately 121 \nwere recruited into the study (see Table 1 for recruitment overview). All \nrecruitment took place between July 8, 2019 and December 14, 2020 \n(Basel) and between October 30, 2019 and December 14, 2020 \n(Besancon). \n2.3. Home visits \nAll interested participants were contacted by phone and screened for \neligibility. If they agreed to take part in the study, a study assistant \nvisited them to explain the study, obtain informed consent, and intro\u00ad\nduce the different parts of the study. In addition, the participants then \nindependently completed an intake questionnaire on a study tablet, \nabout their education and employment, general use of mobile commu\u00ad\nnication technologies, handedness, general health situation and medical \nhistory, cell phone dependence (e.g. addiction), lifestyle and physical \nactivity. \nSubsequently, the study assistant explained the daily assessments in \nwhich the participant would take part in over the next 14 days, in order \nto assess 1) cognitive performance, 2) health-related quality of life \n(HRQoL), and 3) sleep duration and quality. Participants were asked to \ncomplete ten daily assessments within 14 days (allowing them to take \nthe weekends off). The equipment was then collected 14 days later again \nby the study assistant. \n2.4. Daily assessments and health endpoints measured \nIn order to investigate the associations between phone use and the \nthree main health outcomes (cognitive performance, HRQoL and sleep \nduration & quality), study participants completed daily assessments in \nthe early evenings (6\u201310PM) including cognitive testing, a short \nM.

We chose the time point of assessments in the evening time \nbecause a standardized time slot allowed us to limit within-person \nvariability in the outcome due to the time of the day, and in order to \naccommodate most participants had day jobs and were not able to \nperform the assessments during the day. \n2.4.1. Cognitive performance \nWe assessed cognitive performance every evening by asking the \nparticipants to complete a test battery consisting of six quick \u201cgame- \nlike\u201d tests, of which three focused on verbal, and three focused on spatial \nskills (Online Supplement (OS) Fig. 1). Participants received a unique \npersonal link to the test battery and were asked to complete the \nassessment at approximately the same time every day over 10 days, \nusing a tablet or home computer. The whole test battery took approxi\u00ad\nmately 15\u201320 min to complete each evening. Participants were asked to \ncomplete these assessments during the evening, first taking the HRQoL \nquestionnaire, and then completing the cognitive test battery. \nAll tests were based developed in collaboration with Cambridge \nBrain Sciences, and translated into both German (Basel, Switzerland) \nand French (Besancon, France), to allow participants to take them in \ntheir native language. The tests themselves were identical to or similar \nto widely used and well-validated cognition tests such as the Stroop \nColour-Word Test (for executive functions) (Batchelor et al., 1995), and \nthe Corsi block tapping test (for working visuo-spatial memory) (Corsi, \n1972), but were administered in a digital format for increased stan\u00ad\ndardization and reproducibility, and in order to record reaction time. \nThree tests were mainly focused on verbal skills (predominantly left side \nof the brain), and three mainly focused on visuo-spatial skills (pre\u00ad\ndominantly right side of the brain). We recognize that all tests in reality \nrequire more than one function, which can often not be mapped to any \nsingle brain region. (Cambridge Brain Sciences, 2022) OS Fig. 1 shows \ntest instructions and screenshots the final test battery, consisting of the \nsix tests which were each administered to SPUTNIC participants 10 \ntimes. Participants reported liking the short \u201cgame-like\u201d nature of the \ntests, which made them suitable for repeated (daily) use. \n2.4.2. Health-related quality of life and daily mini-questionnaire \nHRQoL was assessed on a daily basis by a short online mini- \nquestionnaire (5 min), which the participants would complete every \nday in a browser. This daily mini-questionnaire collected data on.  \n\u2022 HRQoL and well-being (e.g. fatigue, mood, stress) at the present \nmoment (when answering the questionnaire);  \n\u2022 Exposure-related variables (e.g. looking at the phone within 1 h of \ngoing to bed the previous night, cordless phone use in the last 4 h, \nand mobile phone call duration and screen time during the last 4 h);  \n\u2022 Important time-varying confounders: (e.g. time spent outdoors, \ncoffee and alcohol intake). \n2.4.3. Sleep duration and quality \nSleep duration and quality were measured continuously using a \nFitbit Inspire activity tracker. This is a small wrist-worn device, which is \ncommercially available and can measure the duration, efficiency and \nstages of sleep (awake, light, deep and REM). In addition, it registers the \nnumber of steps the wearer takes throughout the day. During the first \nhome visit by the study assistant, participants provided the information \nneeded to set up a Fitbit Inspire activity tracker (birth year, sex, height \nand weight). The study assistant set up the Fitbit application on the \nparticipant\u2019s phone and configured their personal Fitbit account. We \nretrieved daily sleep duration and stages data for each account via an \nApplication Programming Interface (API). Sleep efficiency was calcu\u00ad\nlated as the time asleep divided by the total time spent in bed * 100%. \n2.5. Exposure assessment \nDaily markers of RF-EMF exposures were collected in the daily \nquestionnaire, during which participants were asked about their call \ntime on cordless phones (in minutes), their total mobile phone call time \n(in minutes) and their total mobile phone screen time (in minutes) in the \n4 h prior to the current assessment, giving an indication of the exposure \nthrough the own use of mobile phones. Previous research showed that \nDECT calls, mobile calls and mobile phone data use are the predominant \ncontributors to personal RF-EMF exposure (Cabr\u00b4e-Riera et al., 2020; van \nWel et al., 2021; Eeftens et al., 2023), and therefore the best exposure \nmarkers for RF-EMF which could be feasibly and repeatedly assessed. \nWe chose 4 h as a typical maximum time frame for short-term human \nlaboratory studies (Bosch-Capblanch et al., 2022). Screen time related \nspecifically to screen time on a smartphone, not including other devices \nsuch as laptops or televisions. Laterality of phone use while calling was \nassessed by questionnaire in the intake questionnaire during the first \nhome visit. \nTable 1 \nCharacteristics of the study population by study center.   \nTotal \nBesancon, FR \nBasel, CH \nP- \nvalue \n121 \n63 \n58  \nAge [years] (mean \n(SD)) \n34.3 (15.5) \n31.4 (13.4) \n37.4 (17.0) \n0.034 \nb \nMale sex (n (%)) \n36 (30) \n15 (24.2) \n21 (36.2) \n0.217 \nc \nHeight [cm] (mean \n(SD) \n169 (8.0) \n168 (7.2) \n170 (8.7) \n0.343 \nb \nWeight [kg] (mean \n(SD)) \n65.5 (14.3) \n65.4 (16.0) \n65.7 (12.5) \n0.898 \nb \nEducation status (n \n(%)) a    \n0.050 \nc \nISCED2 \n1 (0.8) \n0 (0) \n1 (1.7) \nISCED3 \n33 (27.3) \n11 (17.5) \n22 (37.9) \nISCED45 \n16 (13.2) \n12 (19.0) \n4 (6.9) \nISCED6 \n38 (31.4) \n20 (31.7) \n18 (31.0) \nISCED7 \n28 (23.1) \n18 (28.6) \n10 (17.2) \nISCED8 \n5 (4.1) \n2 (3.2) \n3 (5.2) \nEmployment status (n \n(%))    \n0.167 \nc \nEmployed \n50 (41.3) \n29 (46.0) \n21 (36.2) \nStudent \n46 (38.0) \n21 (33.3) \n25 (43.1) \nPensioner \n13 (10.7) \n4 (6.3) \n9 (15.5) \nUnemployed \n9 (7.4) \n7 (11.1) \n2 (3.4) \nOther \n3 (2.5) \n2 (3.2) \n1 (1.7) \nRight-handed (n (%)) \n106 (87.6) \n55 (87.3) \n51 (87.9) \n1.000 \nc \nHand phone use (n \n(%))    \n0.523 \nc \nBoth (n (%)) \n50 (41.3) \n25 (39.7) \n25 (43.1) \nLeft (n (%)) \n21 (17.4) \n9 (14.3) \n12 (20.7) \nRight (n (%)) \n50 (41.3) \n29 (46.0) \n21 (36.2) \nCordless calls [min] \n(median; IQR) d \n0 (0\u20132.7) \n0.04 (0\u20134.5) \n0 (0\u20131.3) \n0.110 \ne \nMobile calls [min] \n(median; IQR) d \n3.0 (0.5\u20138.8) \n4.3 (0.1\u20139.0) \n3.0 (1.0\u20138.3) \n0.746 \ne \nScreen time [min] \n(median; IQR) d \n40.0 \n(24.5\u201368.8) \n47.0 \n(36.2\u201376.7) \n28.0 \n(22.2\u201353.8) \n0.005 \ne \nTotal time [min] \n(median; IQR) d \n46.5 \n(30.0\u201376.8) \n55.5 \n(40.3\u201387.0) \n35.5 \n(25.5\u201364.8 \n0.008 \ne  \na Education status was categorized following the \u201cInternational Standard \nClassification for Education\u201d (ISCED) with categories 2 = Lower secondary ed\u00ad\nucation, 3 = Higher secondary education, grammar school; 45 = Post-secondary, \nnon-tertiary education; 6 = Bachelor, University or teacher\u2019s college or equiv\u00ad\nalent; 7 = Master, University or teacher\u2019s college or equivalent; 8 = Doctorate, \nUniversity. \nb Linear Model ANOVA. \nc Fisher\u2019s exact test. \nd These exposures were assessed daily and repeatedly for each participant.

Cognitive performance \nTest scores were calculated for each participant, for each day, and for \neach of six cognitive tests (focussed on either left or right brain tasks). \nWe calculated normalized the test scores in order to be able to present all \ntests on the same scale, and to enable the combined analysis of the three \nverbal tests, and similarly for the three visuo-spatial tests. Normalized \nscores were calculated by subtracting the test-specific average score and \ndividing by the test-specific standard deviation. We expressed all asso\u00ad\nciations as a percentage change in normalized test scores. The scores for \nthe six individual tests, as well as all visuo-spatial and all verbal tests \ncombined were modelled as a function of the three exposure markers, \nwhich the participant experienced prior to taking the test. We adjusted \nfor coffee and alcohol consumption, time spent outside, type of day \n(workday/non-workday), sleep duration the night before and the \nlearning effect after completing the tests multiple times, following a \ncubic b-spline trend. We studied the association between the three \nmarkers of RF-EMF exposure verbal and visuo-spatial performance. In \naddition, we stratified the analysis for participants who used their phone \non the right side, and those who used their phone on the left side or on \nboth sides, and thus experienced exposure from calls primarily on the \ndifferent sides of the head. \n2.6.2. Health-related quality of life \nScores related to sleepiness, stress and mood were all assessed and \nanalysed on a continuous scale between 1 and 10, as a function of the \nthree RF-EMF exposure markers, adjusting for coffee and alcohol con\u00ad\nsumption, time spent outside, type of day (workday versus non- \nworkday), sleep duration the night before. \n2.6.3. Sleep duration and quality \nSleep duration and efficiency were evaluated on a continuous scale \nas a function of the three RF-EMF exposure markers. We adjusted for \ntime-varying confounders coffee and alcohol consumption and time \nspent outside the day before and type of day (workday/non-workday). \n2.6.4. Mixed modelling \nFor all outcomes (cognitive performance, HRQoL and sleep) we \nconsidered the data from all participants who completed at least three \nassessments on three different days. We analysed the association be\u00ad\ntween each of the three markers of RF-EMF exposure on three endpoints \nusing a mixed modelling approach, adjusting for age and sex, and with \nrandom intercepts for each individual, thereby taking into account the \nsystematic differences between individuals in cognitive performance, \nHRQoL and sleep habits. We chose a linear approach considering there is \nno established dose-response relationship, between the exposure and \nany of the evaluated health outcomes, and as such no indication for \nthreshold effects, plateaus, or other non-linear behavior that would \njustify choosing a more complicated (and likely less interpretable) \nmodel. We considered that there might be a substitution effect (where \nparticipants can only engage in a single exposure related activity at any \none time (cordless phone calls, mobile phone calls, or screen time). In \naddition, we therefore analysed the associations with all phone calls, \nand of the sum of all three exposure markers. All data compilation, \nmanagement and analyses were done in R Version 4.0.3 (R Core Team, \n2013). Mixed models were fitted using the R lme4 package with random \nintercepts for each study participant for all three outcomes. \n3. Results \nA total of 121 participants completed the study: 63 in Besancon and \n58 in Basel. Table 1 shows an overview of their characteristics and the \ndistribution of exposure metrics. Correlations between different expo\u00ad\nsure metrics are shown in OS Fig. 2A, day-to-day variability is shown in \nOS Fig. 3. Participants from Basel were slightly older on average, but \notherwise the populations did not differ significantly between the study \ncenters regarding personal characteristics. In terms of exposure, \nBesancon participants experienced significantly more screen time than \nBasel participants. \n3.1. Associations with cognitive performance \nOut of 121 participants, 101 completed the cognitive assessment at \nleast three times, and had complete exposure and confounder informa\u00ad\ntion available (including sleep quality). Most people completed the \ncognitive assessment 10 times (as instructed), with a range of anywhere \nbetween 3 and 14 times, resulting in a total of 5198 observations for all \nsix cognitive tests combined. Scores from the different tasks showed low \nto moderate positive correlations, indicating that those who did well on \na certain task, were likely to do well on the other tasks also (OS Fig. 2B). \nPersonal means were normally distributed with the exception of the \n\u201cRotations\u201d task (due to a single outlier). See also OS Fig. 4. Table 2 \nshows the average and standard deviation of the scores for each test and \nOS Fig. 5 shows their performance as a function of the assessment \nnumber. This shows that there was a minor improvement in test per\u00ad\nformance with every subsequent assessment (learning effect), and that \nthis improvement was generally greater during the first few assessments, \nfollowed by a plateau, which we adjusted for by a cubic spline.

Out of 24 statistical tests for all partici\u00ad\npants with adjustment for time-varying confounders, two significant \nassociations were observed. For a 10-min increased duration of cordless \ncalls: a \u22120.16 (95% CI: \u22120.30, \u22120.02) change in the normalized test \nscore for the Rotations task. In addition, we found a 0.04 (95% CI: 0.01, \n0.08) increase for the normalized Spatial span task test score for a 10- \nmin increase in duration of mobile phone calls. There were no sub\u00ad\nstantial differences with the non-adjusted estimates (Fig. 1). The asso\u00ad\nciation for the Rotations task tended to be slightly stronger when \nrestricted to participants who used their phones on the right side only, \nbut the Spatial span association was no longer significant. \nIn 72 laterality-stratified statistical tests for phone use on the right \nversus, on both sides, or on the left, we observed ten significant asso\u00ad\nciations (Fig. 1).

Associations with health-related quality of life \nTable 3 presents the distribution of scores (1\u201310) related to fatigue, \nmood and stress. Out of 121 participants, 105 participants completed at \nleast three daily questionnaires about their health-related quality of life, \nas well as sleep registration (confounder), totaling 918 assessments. \nScores from the different HRQoL assessments showed a low correlation, \nwhere fatigue and stress were positively correlated with each other, and \nnegatively correlated with mood (OS Fig. 2C). OS Fig. 6 shows the \ndevelopment of daily scores of HRQoL. Mood was significantly worse on \nworkdays, compared to non-workdays (\u22120.44 (95% CI: \u22120.71, \u22120.17)) \nand people felt more fatigued (0.46 (95% CI: \u22120.16, 0.76)). Males also \nreported lower levels of fatigue (\u22120.90 (95% CI: \u22121.54, \u22120.25)) and \nstress (\u22121.40 (95% CI: \u22122.07, \u22120.72)) than females. Spending time \noutside was associated with an increased mood 0.019 (95% CI: 0.006, \n0.032) per increment of 10 min outside time. \nWe did not see associations between cordless or mobile phone calls \nand any of the HRQoL indicators, but found a reduction of \u22120.03 (95% \nCI: \u22120.07, 0.00) in fatigue and a reduction of \u22120.03 (95% CI: \u22120.06, \n0.00) in the mood people reported for an increment of 10 min of \nadditional mobile phone screen time they reported during the 4 h prior \nto filling in the questionnaire (Fig. 2), although neither was strictly \nstatistically significant. Moreover, their stress increased by approxi\u00ad\nmately the same number of points: 0.03 (95% CI: 0.00, 0.06), which was \nstatistically significant. The association found for the combined expo\u00ad\nsure to cordless and mobile calls were similar to that found for mobile \ncalls, but attenuated. Similarly, we found attenuated associations for all \nthree RF-EMF exposure markers combined, similar to those found for \nscreen time (OS Table 2). \n4.3. Associations with sleep duration & quality \nOut of 121 participants, 105 participants registered at least 3 and up \nto 13 nights of sleep, totaling 918 nights. Table 4 shows the total time in \nbed, total time asleep, sleep efficiency, and the duration of the four sleep \nstages (deep, light, REM and awake). Sleep duration and quality metrics \nwere generally positively correlated with each other, except for the \nduration lying awake (versus all other metrics) and the duration of deep \nsleep versus light sleep (OS Fig. 2D), and OS Fig. 7 shows the day-to-day \nvariability by assessment number. Compared to women, men spent less \ntime asleep (\u221221 min (95% CI: \u221243, \u22126 min), and had reduced sleep \nefficiency (\u22121.3% (95%-CI: \u22122.1%, \u22120.4%)) and REM sleep (\u221211.0% \n(95% CI: \u221221.4%, \u22120.6%)). Participants spent 0.30 min (95% CI: 0.16, \n0.45 min) more lying awake with each year they aged. \nFig. 3 shows the associations between the various sleep outcomes \nlisted and self-reported phone use the day before. We did not find any \nconsistent directions of effect or significant associations across the \ndifferent exposure markers or outcomes. Adjusted and unadjusted effect \nestimates were very similar (Fig. 3), and no associations were found \neither when we summed duration of exposure to cordless and mobile \nphone calls, or all three exposure markers (OS Table 3). \n5. Discussion \nThe study did not find associations between short-term markers of \nRF-EMF exposure and cognitive performance, HRQoL, or sleep duration \nand quality. \nWe only found sporadic significant associations between the RF-EMF \nexposure markers and cognitive performance. The significant associa\u00ad\ntions we found between phone use and cognitive function were not \nconsistent across multiple cognitive tests, and can likely be attributed to \nchance considering the many associations tested. The effect sizes re\u00ad\nported were generally small and not consistent across the three verbal or \nthe three visuo-spatial tasks. Using a significance level of 0.05 as done in \nFig. 1.

    "text": "Environmental Research 231 (2023) 116011\n6\nthis study, one would expect 4.8 significant associations out of 160 \nconducted statistical tests (5 exposures, 8 cognitive tasks, full group and \nright, both and left side users), which fits well the observed fourteen \nsignificant results (of which 5 adverse, and 9 protective), OS Table 1. \nPrevious work found consistently that phone use on the right was \nassociated with a decrease in spatial memory, and phone use on the left \n(or both hands) was associated with a decrease in verbal memory \n(Schoeni et al., 2015, Foerster et al., 2018). This study did not confirm a \nsimilar pattern. There were fourteen associations in agreement with this \npattern and ten contradicting it, most non-significant (Fig. 1, OS \nTable 1). Similar studies also reported no or heterogeneous effects, both \non the long-term (Cabr\u00b4e-Riera et al., 2021) and on the short-term in \ncontrolled exposure settings (Verrender et al., 2016; Vecsei et al., 2018). \nWe found that increased screen time was associated with a small \ntentative decrease in mood and fatigue, and a significant increase in self- \nreported stress level, consistent with previous studies (Cain and Gradi\u00ad\nsar, 2010, Davies et al., 2012; Lacy, Allender et al. 2012; Tang et al., \n2021). While the effect size per 10-min increment was small, we note \nthat the typical interquartile range contrast is much larger for screen \ntime than for calls (either cordless or mobile). On average, participants \nspent 40 min (IQR 24.5\u201368.8 min) looking at the screens of their phones \nwithin the 4 h prior to assessment. The effect of an interquartile range \nincrement in exposure is therefore accordingly larger. Interestingly, no \nsuch effect was present for either cordless or mobile phone calls. Similar \neffects of screen time on HRQoL, especially in combination with lack of \nphysical activity have been shown also in previous studies (Davies et al., \n2012; Lacy, Allender et al. 2012). In line with these studies, we noticed a \nsignificant increase in mood when people reported spending more time \noutside that day. However, we note that surfing the web on the mobile \nphone (usually while connected to a WiFi connection), generates rela\u00ad\ntively little RF-EMF exposure compared to calls. Given the absence of \nassociation for calls involving higher levels of RF-EMF exposure, it is \ntherefore unlikely that such an association with screen time results from \nRF-EMF exposure, and suggests a non-biophysical mechanism. \nIn terms of non-biophysical pathways, various different operating \nmechanisms are discussed. For instance, it has been postulated that e- \nmedia use in adolescents may result in less physical activity (Edelson \net al., 2015), increased night time eating (Cha et al., 2018), higher body \nmass index (BMI) (Fatima et al., 2015), and media addiction (Samaha \nand Hawi, 2016); and any of these mechanisms may interact with the \nFig. 2.

An alternative explanation is an influence \nfrom sleep deprivation through longer waking hours due to the time \nspent on the devices, and consecutive delayed sleep onset (Van den \nBulck, 2007), which then may impair cognitive performance and cause \nsymptoms such as fatigue and exhaustion. We adjusted for sleep dura\u00ad\ntion of the previous night but cannot rule out an impact from chronic \nsleep deprivation not captured by day-to-day variation. Sleep quality \nmight also be impaired as a result of the psychological and somatic \narousal and cognitive over-activation through the media content (Cain \nand Gradisar, 2010). We evaluated stress as an outcome, but cannot \nexclude that it may be (in addition) a mediator or moderator for un\u00ad\nmeasured effects or other endpoints. Due to small sample size, we were \nnot able to perform these analyses formally. \nWe did not find any consistent associations between markers of RF- \nEMF exposure and sleep duration and quality. This is consistent with \nseveral other previous studies, which have noted differences in EEG \n(Curcio et al., 2005; Regel et al., 2007), but no reduction in sleep \nduration or quality (Regel et al., 2007; Eggert et al., 2020). \nStrengths of the study include its repeated study design and the high \nnumber of repeated observations per individual, which allowed us to \nstudy the day-to-day variability both in exposure and the various health \nendpoints, on the short term. Even if we have high temporal resolution, \nreverse causality or a \u201cvicious spiral\u201d effect cannot be excluded. Indeed, \nworse mood and higher stress level may have preceded and resulted in \nmore time spent in front of the screen, possibly causing further mood \ndecline and stress, and so on. \nA limitation of the study include its relatively small sample size of \n121 individuals, which is further reduced to 101 or 105 by missing data \nfor exposure and time-varying confounders for the different outcomes. \nWe performed a priori power calculations assuming cognitive effects \nsimilar to those found by Foerster et al. (2018) (Foerster et al., 2018), \nwho found a 2.6% decrease in verbal memory and a 3.9% decrease in \nspatial memory for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in exposure. \nWe further assumed similar exposure contrasts and a learning effect of \n2% over 10 days, which indicated that a minimum of 100 participants \nwould be needed to reach 80% power. While the recruitment target was \nreached, the study may still have been underpowered to detect possible \neffects smaller than those assumed in the power calculation. We note \nthat we analysed repeated observations, which increases the statistical \npower compared to a conventional analysis of between-subject vari\u00ad\nability. The small sample size, however, may be a limitation for the \ngeneralizability of our findings. While we found sporadic significant \nassociations with the RF-EMF exposure markers, these were few in \nnumber and not consistent across multiple cognitive tests or between \ndifferent exposure markers. Given that false positive rate is 5%, six \nsignificant findings among 72 associations between exposure and \ncognitive test results and zero significant associations among 21 sleep \nanalyses are compatible with chance findings. Nevertheless, despite the \nsmall sample size, the finding of a significant adverse association be\u00ad\ntween screen time and stress, and tendencies towards a worse mood and \nreduced fatigue (although not significant) make associations between \nscreen time and HRQoL less likely to be due to chance findings. \nAnother limitation is exposure misclassification: we have a good idea \nabout day-to-day variability in exposure due to cordless phone calls, \nmobile phone calls and data traffic using the own mobile phone, we \nacknowledge that there are other sources of RF-EMF radiation which \nwere not assessed as part of this study (e.g. environmental sources, and \nusage of personal communication devices such as tablets and laptops, \ntelevisions). It was not feasible to assess exposure in real-time, or ask \nparticipants on a daily basis about multiple time frames of exposure, side \nof use, distance to the head, hands-free use, for all possible devices. Our \nchoice to assess RF-EMF exposure metrics in the 4-h period prior to \nhealth assessments was based on the maximum time frame typical \nhuman laboratory studies on short-term effects have considered \n(Bosch-Capblanch et al., 2022). We acknowledge that there is no \nestablished lag time for the effect\u2019s onset, or typical duration of effect, \nwhich may have resulted in bias to the mean (explaining a lack of effect). \nIn addition, duration of calls and screen time are likely to be crude \nproxies of the actual RF-EMF dose (Calder\u00b4on et al., 2022), which further \ndepends on the connectivity, as well as phone characteristics (e.g. Spe\u00ad\ncific Absorption Rate) and the frequency of the used service (Mazloum, \nAerts et al. 2019). However, recent research based on measurements and \nexposure models have shown that mobile phone calls are still by far the \nlargest source of personal exposure (Roser et al., 2015), particularly \nexposure to the head, so it is unlikely that this would have resulted in \nlarge and systematic misclassification. We relied on self-reported use, \nwhich is subject to some uncertainty. However, to estimate duration of \nuse for the last 4 h is substantially less demanding than life-time use as \nrequested in epidemiological studies on long term effects. Moreover, \nsince exposure information was provided before doing the test and \nknowing the test performance, we do not expect differential exposure \nmisclassification. \n6. Conclusion \nWe aimed to measure the association between daily markers of RF- \nEMF exposure (within 4 h prior to outcome assessment) and three \ndistinct short-term health outcomes: cognitive performance, HRQoL and \nsleep duration & quality, by performing daily assessments of both in a \ngroup of adult volunteers. Inconsistent findings for cognitive test and \nabsence of associations for sleep outcomes are in line with other studies \nso far, and also the effects of screen time on various HRQoL have pre\u00ad\nviously been indicated. \nCredit author statement \nMarloes Eeftens: Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal analysis, \nData curation, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing, \nVisualization, Supervision, Project administration, Funding acquisition. \nSophie Pujol: Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal analysis, Data \ncuration, Writing \u2013 review & editing, Visualization, Supervision, Project \nadministration, Funding acquisition.
