      "text": "Large language models are being utilized in education to assist teachers in curriculum development, such as generating inclusive lesson plans, course syllabi, and topic descriptions (c0001). They can also create assessment questions and prompts designed to foster critical thinking (c0001, c0011). For students, LLMs can aid in organizing thoughts for writing, developing research skills by suggesting topics and providing resources (c0002), and improving reading and writing skills, including grammatical corrections and fostering writing style (c0009). Furthermore, LLMs can significantly reduce the burden of grading in large courses, with potential for semi-automation (c0003). They can also generate programming tasks, solutions, and explanations, aiding in student learning and assessment (c0004). LLMs can also provide teachers with resources and explanations on new teaching methodologies (c0010) and answer natural language questions to integrate diverse digital applications (c0012). However, a challenge exists regarding the inclusivity of lesson plans, as LLMs may generate biased content (c0001). Additionally, the extent to which LLMs develop research skills is questioned, with concerns about potential negative impacts on critical thinking and independent investigation (c0002). The claim of up to 85% reduction in grading effort is not directly supported by evidence, which only mentions semi-automation (c0003). The evidence for OpenAI Codex generating programming tasks, solutions, and tests is also limited, with explicit mention only of code explanations and assessment questions (c0004).",

Current Research and Applications of\nLanguage Models in Education\n2.1 Overview of Current Large Language Models\nThe GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) [10] model\ndeveloped by OpenAI was the first large language model that\nwas publicly released in 2018. GPT was able to generate\nhuman-like text, answer questions, and assist in tasks, such as\ntranslation and summarization, through human-like comple-\ntion. Based on this initial model, OpenAI later released the\nGPT-2 and GPT-3 models with more advanced capabilities.\nIt can be argued that the release of GPT marked a significant\nmilestone in the field of NLP and has opened up many ways\nfor dissemination, both in research and industrial applications.\nAnother model that was released by Google Research in\n2018 is BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers [2]), which is also based on a transformer ar-\nchitecture and is pre-trained on a massive dataset of text data\non two unsupervised tasks, namely masked language mod-\neling (to predict missing parts in a sentence and learn their\ncontext) and next sentence prediction (to learn plausible sub-\nsequent sentences of a given sentence) with the aim to learn\nthe broader context of words in various topics.\nOne year later in 2019, Google AI released XLNet [11],\nwhich is trained using a process called permutation language\nmodeling and enables XLNet to cope with tasks that involve\nunderstanding the dependencies between words in a sentence,\ne.g., natural language inference and question answering. An-\nother model developed by Google Research was T5 (Text-to-\nText Transfer Transformer) [12], which was released in 2020.\nLike the predecessor models, T5 is also transformer-based\nmodel trained on a massive text dataset with the key feature\nbeing its ability to perform many NLP tasks with a single\npre-training and fine-tuning pipeline.\nIn parallel with Open AI and Google, Facebook AI devel-\noped a large language model called RoBERTa (Robustly Opti-\nmized BERT Pre-training) [13], which was released in 2019.\nRoBERTa is a variant of the BERT model which uses dynamic\nmasking instead of static masking"

Overall,\nthe teachers from the study seemed to have a basic level of\ndigital skills but low AI-related skills [31]. Another study\nwith Nigerian teachers emphasized that the willingness and\nreadiness of teachers to promote AI are key prerequisites for\nthe integration of AI-based technologies in education [32].\nAlong the same lines, the results of a study with teachers from\nSouth Korea indicate that teachers with constructivist beliefs\nare more likely to integrate educational AI-based tools than\nteachers with transmissive orientations [33].

Similar results\nconcerning teachers attitudes towards chatbots in education\nwere reported in [34]: perceiving the AI chatbot as easy-to-\nuse and useful leads to greater acceptance of the chatbot.

One example is in the creation and design of\neducational content. For example, researchers have used large\nlanguage models to generate interactive educational materials\nsuch as quizzes and flashcards, which can be used to improve\nstudent learning and engagement [16, 17]. More specifically,\nin a recent work by Dijkstra et al. [17], researchers have used\nGPT-3 to generate multiple-choice questions and answers\nfor a reading comprehension task and argue that automated\ngeneration of quizzes not only reduces the burden of manual\nquiz design for teachers but, above all, provides a helpful tool\nfor students to train and test their knowledge while learning\nfrom textbooks and during exam preparation [17].\nIn another recent work, GPT-3 was employed as a ped-\nagogical agent to stimulate the curiosity of children and en-\nhance question-asking skills [18]. More specifically, the au-\nthors automated the generation of curiosity-prompting cues\nas an incentive for asking more and deeper questions. Ac-\ncording to their results, large language models not only bear\nthe potential to significantly facilitate the implementation of\ncuriosity-stimulating learning but can also serve as an efficient\ntool towards an increased curiosity expression [18].\nIn computing education, a recent work by MacNeil et\nal. [19] has employed GPT-3 to generate code explanations.\nDespite several open research and pedagogical questions that\nneed to be further explored, this work has successfully demon-\nstrated the potential of GPT-3 to support learning by explain-\ning aspects of a given code snippet.\nFor a data science course, Bhat et al. [20] proposed a\npipeline for generating assessment questions based on a fine-\ntuned"

Additionally,\nlarge language models can also assist in the development of\nresearch skills by providing students with information and re-\nsources on a particular topic and hinting at unexplored aspects\nand current research topics, which can help them to better\nunderstand and analyze the material.\nFor group & remote learning, large language models\ncan be used to facilitate group discussions and debates by\nproviding a discussion structure, real-time feedback and per-\nsonalized guidance to students during the discussion. This\ncan help to improve student engagement and participation. In\ncollaborative writing activities, where multiple students work\ntogether to write a document or a project, language models\ncan assist by providing style and editing suggestions as well\nas other integrative co-writing features. For research purposes,\nsuch models can be used to span the range of open research\nquestions in relation to already researched topics and to au-\ntomatically assign the questions and topics to the involved\nteam members. For remote tutoring purposes, they can be\nused to automatically generate questions and provide practice\nproblems, explanations, and assessments that are tailored to\nthe students\u2019 level of knowledge so that they can learn at their\nown pace.\nTo empower learners with disabilities, large language\nmodels can be used in combination with speech-to-text or text-\nto-speech solutions to help people with visual impairment. In\ncombination with the previously mentioned group and remote\ntutoring opportunities, language models can be used to de-\nvelop inclusive learning strategies with adequate support in\ntasks such as adaptive writing, translating, and highlighting\nof important content in various formats. However, it is im-\nportant to note that the use of large language models should\nbe accompanied by the help of professionals such as speech\ntherapists, educators, and other specialists that can adapt the\ntechnology to the specific needs of the learner\u2019s disabilities.\nFor professional training, large language models can\nassist in the development of language skills that are specific\nto a particular field of work.
