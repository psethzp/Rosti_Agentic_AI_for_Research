Current Research and Applications of\nLanguage Models in Education\n2.1 Overview of Current Large Language Models\nThe GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) [10] model\ndeveloped by OpenAI was the first large language model that\nwas publicly released in 2018. GPT was able to generate\nhuman-like text, answer questions, and assist in tasks, such as\ntranslation and summarization, through human-like comple-\ntion. Based on this initial model, OpenAI later released the\nGPT-2 and GPT-3 models with more advanced capabilities.\nIt can be argued that the release of GPT marked a significant\nmilestone in the field of NLP and has opened up many ways\nfor dissemination, both in research and industrial applications.\nAnother model that was released by Google Research in\n2018 is BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers [2]), which is also based on a transformer ar-\nchitecture and is pre-trained on a massive dataset of text data\non two unsupervised tasks, namely masked language mod-\neling (to predict missing parts in a sentence and learn their\ncontext) and next sentence prediction (to learn plausible sub-\nsequent sentences of a given sentence) with the aim to learn\nthe broader context of words in various topics.\nOne year later in 2019, Google AI released XLNet [11],\nwhich is trained using a process called permutation language\nmodeling and enables XLNet to cope with tasks that involve\nunderstanding the dependencies between words in a sentence,\ne.g., natural language inference and question answering. An-\nother model developed by Google Research was T5 (Text-to-\nText Transfer Transformer) [12], which was released in 2020.\nLike the predecessor models, T5 is also transformer-based\nmodel trained on a massive text dataset with the key feature\nbeing its ability to perform many NLP tasks with a single\npre-training and fine-tuning pipeline.\nIn parallel with Open AI and Google, Facebook AI devel-\noped a large language model called RoBERTa (Robustly Opti-\nmized BERT Pre-training) [13], which was released in 2019.\nRoBERTa is a variant of the BERT model which uses dynamic\nmasking instead of static masking"
