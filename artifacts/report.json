Despite the efforts of various\nresearch communities to address multilingualism fairness for\nAI technologies, there is still much room for improvement.\nLastly, the unfairness related to financial means for access-\ning, training and maintaining large language models may need\nto be regulated by governmental organisations with the aim\nto provide equity-oriented means to all educational entities\ninterested in using these modern technologies. Without fair\naccess, this AI technology may seriously widen the education\ngap like no other technology before it.\nWe therefore conclude with UNESCO\u2019s call to ensure that\nAI does not widen the technological and educational divides\nwithin and between countries, and recommended important\nstrategies for the use of AI in a responsible and fair way to\nreduce this existing gap instead. According to the UNESCO\neducation 2030 Agenda [67]: \u201cUNESCO\u2019s mandate calls in-\nherently for a human-centred approach to AI.

Concluding Remarks\nThe use of large language models in education is a promising\narea of research that offers many opportunities to enhance the\nlearning experience for students and support the work of teach-\ners. However, to unleash their full potential for education, it is\ncrucial to approach the use of these models with caution and\nto critically evaluate their limitations and potential biases. In-\ntegrating large language models into education must therefore\nmeet stringent privacy, security, and - for sustainable scal-\ning - environmental, regulatory and ethical requirements, and\nmust be done in conjunction with ongoing human monitoring,\nguidance, and critical thinking.\nWhile this position paper reflects the optimism of the au-\nthors about the opportunities of large language models as a\ntransformative technology in"

They can\nbe used to improve the clarity of the teaching materials, locate\ninformation or resources that professionals may be in need for\nas they learn on the job, as well as used for on-the-job training\nmodules that require presentation and communication skills.\nFor assessment and evaluation, teachers can use large\nlanguage models to semi-automate the grading of student work\nby highlighting potential strengths and weakness of the work\nin question, e.g., essays, research papers, and other writing\nassignments. This can save teachers a significant amount of\ntime for tasks related to individualized feedback to students.\nFurthermore, large language models can also be used to check\nfor plagiarism, which can help to prevent cheating.
