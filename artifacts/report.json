They also aid students in improving their reading and writing skills through grammatical corrections and style enhancements (c0001). Furthermore, LLMs can automate the creation of educational materials, such as programming exercises with solutions and math word problems, which have been favorably reviewed by experts (c0002). The ability of LLMs to generate contextualized text and code scales the production of educational content, and their adaptability allows for specialized applications, like supporting learners with disabilities (c0004).

One example is in the creation and design of\neducational content. For example, researchers have used large\nlanguage models to generate interactive educational materials\nsuch as quizzes and flashcards, which can be used to improve\nstudent learning and engagement [16, 17]. More specifically,\nin a recent work by Dijkstra et al. [17], researchers have used\nGPT-3 to generate multiple-choice questions and answers\nfor a reading comprehension task and argue that automated\ngeneration of quizzes not only reduces the burden of manual\nquiz design for teachers but, above all, provides a helpful tool\nfor students to train and test their knowledge while learning\nfrom textbooks and during exam preparation [17].\nIn another recent work, GPT-3 was employed as a ped-\nagogical agent to stimulate the curiosity of children and en-\nhance question-asking skills [18]. More specifically, the au-\nthors automated the generation of curiosity-prompting cues\nas an incentive for asking more and deeper questions. Ac-\ncording to their results, large language models not only bear\nthe potential to significantly facilitate the implementation of\ncuriosity-stimulating learning but can also serve as an efficient\ntool towards an increased curiosity expression [18].\nIn computing education, a recent work by MacNeil et\nal. [19] has employed GPT-3 to generate code explanations.\nDespite several open research and pedagogical questions that\nneed to be further explored, this work has successfully demon-\nstrated the potential of GPT-3 to support learning by explain-\ning aspects of a given code snippet.\nFor a data science course, Bhat et al.

Current Research and Applications of\nLanguage Models in Education\n2.1 Overview of Current Large Language Models\nThe GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) [10] model\ndeveloped by OpenAI was the first large language model that\nwas publicly released in 2018. GPT was able to generate\nhuman-like text, answer questions, and assist in tasks, such as\ntranslation and summarization, through human-like comple-\ntion. Based on this initial model, OpenAI later released the\nGPT-2 and GPT-3 models with more advanced capabilities.\nIt can be argued that the release of GPT marked a significant\nmilestone in the field of NLP and has opened up many ways\nfor dissemination, both in research and industrial applications.\nAnother model that was released by Google Research in\n2018 is BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers [2]), which is also based on a transformer ar-\nchitecture and is pre-trained on a massive dataset of text data\non two unsupervised tasks, namely masked language mod-\neling (to predict missing parts in a sentence and learn their\ncontext) and next sentence prediction (to learn plausible sub-\nsequent sentences of a given sentence) with the aim to learn\nthe broader context of words in various topics.\nOne year later in 2019, Google AI released XLNet [11],\nwhich is trained using a process called permutation language\nmodeling and enables XLNet to cope with tasks that involve\nunderstanding the dependencies between words in a sentence,\ne.g., natural language inference and question answering. An-\nother model developed by Google Research was T5 (Text-to-\nText Transfer Transformer) [12], which was released in 2020.\nLike the predecessor models, T5 is also transformer-based\nmodel trained on a massive text dataset with the key feature\nbeing its ability to perform many NLP tasks with a single\npre-training and fine-tuning pipeline.\nIn parallel with Open AI and Google, Facebook AI devel-\noped a large language model called RoBERTa (Robustly Opti-\nmized BERT Pre-training) [13], which was released in 2019.\nRoBERTa is a variant of the BERT model which uses dynamic\nmasking instead of static masking"

Introduction\nLarge language models, such as GPT-3 [1], have made signifi-\ncant advancements in natural language processing (NLP) in\nrecent years. These models are trained on massive amounts\nof text data and are able to generate human-like text, answer\nquestions, and complete other language-related tasks with\nhigh accuracy.\nOne key development in the area is the use of trans-\nformer architectures [2, 3] and the underlying attention mech-\nanism [4], which have greatly improved the ability of auto-\nregressive1 self-supervised2 language models to handle long-\n1Auto-regressive because the model uses its previous predictions as input\nfor new predictions.\n2Self-supervised because they learn from the data itself, rather than being\nexplicitly provided with correct answers as in supervised learning.\nrange dependencies in natural-language texts. The transformer\narchitecture, introduced in [4], uses the self-attention mecha-\nnism to determine the relevance of different parts of the input\nwhen generating predictions. This allows the model to better\nunderstand the relationships between words in a sentence, re-\ngardless of their position.\nAnother important development is the use of pre-training,\nwhere a model is first trained on a large dataset before being\nfine-tuned on a specific task. This has proven to be an effec-\ntive technique for improving performance on a wide range of\nlanguage tasks [5]. For example, BERT [2] is a pre-trained\ntransformer-based encoder model that can be fine-tuned on\nvarious NLP tasks, such as sentence classification, question\nanswering and named entity recognition. In fact, the so-called\nfew-shot learning capability of large language models to be"

These models are trained on massive amounts\nof text data and are able to generate human-like text, answer\nquestions, and complete other language-related tasks with\nhigh accuracy.\nOne key development in the area is the use of trans-\nformer architectures [2, 3] and the underlying attention mech-\nanism [4], which have greatly improved the ability of auto-\nregressive1 self-supervised2 language models to handle long-\n1Auto-regressive because the model uses its previous predictions as input\nfor new predictions.\n2Self-supervised because they learn from the data itself, rather than being\nexplicitly provided with correct answers as in supervised learning.\nrange dependencies in natural-language texts. The transformer\narchitecture, introduced in [4], uses the self-attention mecha-\nnism to determine the relevance of different parts of the input\nwhen generating predictions. This allows the model to better\nunderstand the relationships between words in a sentence, re-\ngardless of their position.\nAnother important development is the use of pre-training,\nwhere a model is first trained on a large dataset before being\nfine-tuned on a specific task. This has proven to be an effec-\ntive technique for improving performance on a wide range of\nlanguage tasks [5]. For example, BERT [2] is a pre-trained\ntransformer-based encoder model that can be fine-tuned on\nvarious NLP tasks, such as sentence classification, question\nanswering and named entity recognition.
