These studies have been discussed in the following\naccording to their target groups, i.e., learners or teachers.\nLearners\u2019 perspective.\nFrom a student\u2019s perspective, large\nlanguage models can be used in multiple ways to assist the\nlearning process. One example is in the creation and design of\neducational content. For example, researchers have used large\nlanguage models to generate interactive educational materials\nsuch as quizzes and flashcards, which can be used to improve\nstudent learning and engagement [16, 17]. More specifically,\nin a recent work by Dijkstra et al. [17], researchers have used\nGPT-3 to generate multiple-choice questions and answers\nfor a reading comprehension task and argue that automated\ngeneration of quizzes not only reduces the burden of manual\nquiz design for teachers but, above all, provides a helpful tool\nfor students to train and test their knowledge while learning\nfrom textbooks and during exam preparation [17].\nIn another recent work, GPT-3 was employed as a ped-\nagogical agent to stimulate the curiosity of children and en-\nhance question-asking skills [18]. More specifically, the au-\nthors automated the generation of curiosity-prompting cues\nas an incentive for asking more and deeper questions. Ac-\ncording to their results, large language models not only bear\nthe potential to significantly facilitate the implementation of\ncuriosity-stimulating learning but can also serve as an efficient\ntool towards an increased curiosity expression [18].\nIn computing education, a recent work by MacNeil et\nal. [19] has employed GPT-3 to generate code explanations.\nDespite several open research and pedagogical questions that\nneed to be further explored, this work has successfully demon-\nstrated the potential of GPT-3 to support learning by explain-\ning aspects of a given code snippet.\nFor a data science course, Bhat et al.

Addi-\ntionally, RoBERTa is trained on a much larger dataset, and\nhence clearly outperformed BERT and other models such as\nGPT-2 and XLNet by the time of its release.\nCurrently, the most widely used and the largest available\nlanguage model is GPT-3, which was also pre-trained on a\nmassive text dataset (including books, articles, and websites,\namong other sources) and has 175 billion parameters. As all\nother previously described language models, GPT-3 uses a\ntransformer architecture, which allows it to efficiently process\nsequential data and generate more coherent and contextually\nadjusted text. Indeed, text generated by GPT-3 is almost\nindistinguishable from human-written text [14].

The aim of this project was to provide a transparently\ntrained multi-lingual language model for the academic and\nnon-profit community.

An-\nother model developed by Google Research was T5 (Text-to-\nText Transfer Transformer) [12], which was released in 2020.\nLike the predecessor models, T5 is also transformer-based\nmodel trained on a massive text dataset with the key feature\nbeing its ability to perform many NLP tasks with a single\npre-training and fine-tuning pipeline.\nIn parallel with Open AI and Google, Facebook AI devel-\noped a large language model called RoBERTa (Robustly Opti-\nmized BERT Pre-training) [13], which was released in 2019.\nRoBERTa is a variant of the BERT model which uses dynamic\nmasking instead of static masking"

Introduction\nLarge language models, such as GPT-3 [1], have made signifi-\ncant advancements in natural language processing (NLP) in\nrecent years. These models are trained on massive amounts\nof text data and are able to generate human-like text, answer\nquestions, and complete other language-related tasks with\nhigh accuracy.\nOne key development in the area is the use of trans-\nformer architectures [2, 3] and the underlying attention mech-\nanism [4], which have greatly improved the ability of auto-\nregressive1 self-supervised2 language models to handle long-\n1Auto-regressive because the model uses its previous predictions as input\nfor new predictions.\n2Self-supervised because they learn from the data itself, rather than being\nexplicitly provided with correct answers as in supervised learning.\nrange dependencies in natural-language texts. The transformer\narchitecture, introduced in [4], uses the self-attention mecha-\nnism to determine the relevance of different parts of the input\nwhen generating predictions. This allows the model to better\nunderstand the relationships between words in a sentence, re-\ngardless of their position.\nAnother important development is the use of pre-training,\nwhere a model is first trained on a large dataset before being\nfine-tuned on a specific task. This has proven to be an effec-\ntive technique for improving performance on a wide range of\nlanguage tasks [5]. For example, BERT [2] is a pre-trained\ntransformer-based encoder model that can be fine-tuned on\nvarious NLP tasks, such as sentence classification, question\nanswering and named entity recognition. In fact, the so-called\nfew-shot learning capability of large language models to be"

They can assist\nin the development of reading, writing, math, science, and\nlanguage skills, as well as providing students with personal-\nized practice materials, summaries and explanations, which\ncan help to improve student performance and contribute to en-\nhanced learning experiences. Additionally, large language\nmodels can also assist in research, writing, and problem-\nsolving tasks, and provide domain-specific language skills\nand other skills for professional training. However, as pre-\nviously mentioned, the use of these models should be done\nwith caution, as they also have limitations such as lack of\ninterpretability and potential for bias, unexpected brittleness\nin relatively simple tasks [9] which need to be addressed.\n1.2 Opportunities for Teaching\nLarge language models, such as ChatGPT, have the potential\nto revolutionize teaching and assist in teaching processes.\nBelow we provide only a few examples of how these models\ncan benefit teachers:\nFor personalized learning, teachers can use large lan-\nguage models to create personalized learning experiences for\ntheir students. These models can analyze student\u2019s writing\nand responses, and provide tailored feedback and suggest ma-\nterials that align with the student\u2019s specific learning needs.\nSuch support can save teachers\u2019 time and effort in creating\npersonalized materials and feedback, and also allow them to\nfocus on other aspects of teaching, such as creating engaging\nand interactive lessons.\nFor lesson planning, large language models can also as-\nsist teachers in the creation of (inclusive) lesson plans and\nactivities. Teachers can input to the models the corpus of\ndocument based on which they want to build a course. The\noutput can be a course syllabus with short description of each\ntopic. Language models can also generate questions and\nprompts that encourage the participation of people at"
