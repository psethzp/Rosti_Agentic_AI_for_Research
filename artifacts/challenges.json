Despite the efforts of various\nresearch communities to address multilingualism fairness for\nAI technologies, there is still much room for improvement.\nLastly, the unfairness related to financial means for access-\ning, training and maintaining large language models may need\nto be regulated by governmental organisations with the aim\nto provide equity-oriented means to all educational entities\ninterested in using these modern technologies. Without fair\naccess, this AI technology may seriously widen the education\ngap like no other technology before it.\nWe therefore conclude with UNESCO\u2019s call to ensure that\nAI does not widen the technological and educational divides\nwithin and between countries, and recommended important\nstrategies for the use of AI in a responsible and fair way to\nreduce this existing gap instead.

However, to unleash their full potential for education, it is\ncrucial to approach the use of these models with caution and\nto critically evaluate their limitations and potential biases.
