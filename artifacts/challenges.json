These studies have been discussed in the following\naccording to their target groups, i.e., learners or teachers.\nLearners\u2019 perspective.\nFrom a student\u2019s perspective, large\nlanguage models can be used in multiple ways to assist the\nlearning process. One example is in the creation and design of\neducational content. For example, researchers have used large\nlanguage models to generate interactive educational materials\nsuch as quizzes and flashcards, which can be used to improve\nstudent learning and engagement [16, 17]. More specifically,\nin a recent work by Dijkstra et al. [17], researchers have used\nGPT-3 to generate multiple-choice questions and answers\nfor a reading comprehension task and argue that automated\ngeneration of quizzes not only reduces the burden of manual\nquiz design for teachers but, above all, provides a helpful tool\nfor students to train and test their knowledge while learning\nfrom textbooks and during exam preparation [17].\nIn another recent work, GPT-3 was employed as a ped-\nagogical agent to stimulate the curiosity of children and en-\nhance question-asking skills [18]. More specifically, the au-\nthors automated the generation of curiosity-prompting cues\nas an incentive for asking more and deeper questions. Ac-\ncording to their results, large language models not only bear\nthe potential to significantly facilitate the implementation of\ncuriosity-stimulating learning but can also serve as an efficient\ntool towards an increased curiosity expression [18].\nIn computing education, a recent work by MacNeil et\nal.

Additionally,\nlarge language models can also assist in the development of\nresearch skills by providing students with information and re-\nsources on a particular topic and hinting at unexplored aspects\nand current research topics, which can help them to better\nunderstand and analyze the material.\nFor group & remote learning, large language models\ncan be used to facilitate group discussions and debates by\nproviding a discussion structure, real-time feedback and per-\nsonalized guidance to students during the discussion. This\ncan help to improve student engagement and participation. In\ncollaborative writing activities, where multiple students work\ntogether to write a document or a project, language models\ncan assist by providing style and editing suggestions as well\nas other integrative co-writing features. For research purposes,\nsuch models can be used to span the range of open research\nquestions in relation to already researched topics and to au-\ntomatically assign the questions and topics to the involved\nteam members. For remote tutoring purposes, they can be\nused to automatically generate questions and provide practice\nproblems, explanations, and assessments that are tailored to\nthe students\u2019 level of knowledge so that they can learn at their\nown pace.\nTo empower learners with disabilities, large language\nmodels can be used in combination with speech-to-text or text-\nto-speech solutions to help people with visual impairment.
