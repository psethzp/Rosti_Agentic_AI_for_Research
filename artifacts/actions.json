    "detail": "Given the significant risk of LLMs perpetuating biases and fading local knowledge (c0001), a proactive approach is needed. This action proposes the development of a comprehensive framework that outlines strategies for identifying, measuring, and mitigating bias in LLM outputs used in educational contexts. This framework should include guidelines for data diversity, continuous model updates, and expert human supervision, as well as recommendations for educator training on recognizing and addressing bias.",

    "detail": "The concern that learners may become too reliant on LLMs, impacting critical thinking and problem-solving (c0002), requires deeper investigation. This action hypothesizes that the negative impact on cognitive skills is more pronounced in younger learners or those with less developed metacognitive abilities. Research should focus on longitudinal studies and comparative analyses across different age groups and educational levels to understand the nuances of this over-reliance and inform curriculum design that promotes complementary LLM use.",

This action aims to identify the specific financial and infrastructural barriers that prevent equitable access to LLMs for all educational entities. This could involve surveying institutions, analyzing the cost of LLM implementation and maintenance, and exploring potential governmental or philanthropic funding models to ensure fair access and prevent widening educational gaps.",

This action hypothesizes that specific integration models, such as LLMs as brainstorming partners, research assistants, or personalized feedback providers, can demonstrably enhance student learning and skill development without fostering over-reliance. Research should focus on designing and testing these models to identify best practices for leveraging LLMs to augment human instruction and student capabilities.",
