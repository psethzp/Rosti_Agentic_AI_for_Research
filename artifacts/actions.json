    "detail": "Given the challenge that LLMs may negatively impact students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills due to over-reliance (c0001), and the assertion that LLMs should supplement, not replace, human instruction to ensure development of critical thinking skills (c0004), further research is needed to quantify this impact. This could involve comparative studies of student cohorts using LLMs extensively versus those with limited LLM use, focusing on metrics of critical thinking and problem-solving.",

This next step involves researching and proposing technical or stylistic markers that can reliably differentiate LLM outputs from human student work in educational contexts, particularly for grading and assessment purposes.",

    "detail": "The challenge that the claim highlights LLMs' ability to generate educational content, but the evidence focuses more on teacher attitudes and professional development support (c0002), indicates a potential gap in understanding the practical application of LLMs in student assessment. A clarification is needed to determine if the primary use case is in generating materials for teachers to use, or if LLMs are directly involved in evaluating student work, and to what degree.",
