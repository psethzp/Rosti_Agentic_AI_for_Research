    "detail": "Given the challenge that LLMs might introduce bias into inclusive lesson plans (c0001), a follow-up action should be to research and develop methods for detecting and mitigating bias in LLM-generated educational materials. This could involve prompt engineering techniques, fine-tuning on diverse datasets, or post-generation review processes.",

    "detail": "To address the concern that LLMs might negatively impact critical thinking and independent investigation in research (c0002), a hypothesis to test is that guided LLM usage, focusing on idea generation and resource discovery rather than direct answer provision, can actually enhance research skills. This would require designing experiments to measure the depth and originality of student research with and without specific LLM guidance.",

    "detail": "The challenge states that the 85% grading reduction (c0003) is not directly supported, with evidence only mentioning semi-automation. A clarification is needed on the specific types of grading tasks LLMs can automate and the extent of human oversight required to achieve significant time savings. This would involve reviewing the original sources for c0003 and potentially conducting further studies on LLM grading efficiency.",

A next step is to investigate the capabilities of models like OpenAI Codex in generating complete programming tasks and their corresponding correct solutions. This could involve empirical testing of the model's output against defined task requirements.",

Further research should explore how LLMs can be integrated into training scenarios to facilitate skill development through interactive exercises and feedback.",
