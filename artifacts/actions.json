    "detail": "Given the challenge that LLMs may overstate their ability to create inclusive lesson plans and tailor content to diverse student needs due to potential bias (c0001), we need to explore how to actively mitigate these biases. This could involve developing specific prompt engineering techniques, fine-tuning models on diverse datasets, or implementing human review processes to ensure true inclusivity.",

We need to hypothesize and then design studies to quantify this risk. What are the specific metrics or observable behaviors that indicate over-reliance, and at what point does LLM assistance transition from beneficial to detrimental for skill development?.",

Are there specific LLM architectures or techniques that are proving more effective, and what are the limitations of these detection methods?.",

To address this, we need to define specific educational tasks (e.g., providing nuanced feedback on complex essays, adapting explanations in real-time to a student's confusion) and design comparative studies. This will help us understand where LLMs excel, where they fall short, and what the realistic expectations for their current capabilities should be.",

We should hypothesize about the effectiveness of hybrid models where LLMs act as powerful assistants but are integrated into a framework that explicitly guides students through the research process, emphasizing critical evaluation of LLM-provided information and encouraging independent exploration.",
